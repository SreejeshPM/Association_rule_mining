Introduction \\n1. The National Planning Policy Framework sets out the Government’s planning \\npolicies for England and how these should be applied1. It provides a framework \\nwithin which locally -prepared plans for housing and other development can be \\nproduced.   \\n 2. Planning law requires that applications for planning permission be determined in accordance with the development plan\\n2, unless material considerations indicate \\notherwise3. The National Planning Policy Framework must be taken into account in \\nprepar ing the development plan , and is a material consideration in planning \\ndecisions. Planning policies and decisions must also reflect relevant international \\nobligations and statutory requirements.  \\n 3. The Framework should be read as a whole (including its footnotes and annexes) . \\nGeneral references to planning policies in the Framework should be applied in a \\nway that is appropriate  to the type of plan being produced, taking into account \\npolicy on plan- making in chapter 3. \\n 4. The Framework should be read in conjunction with the Government’s planning policy for traveller sites, and its planning policy for waste. When preparing plans or making decisions on applications for these types of development, regard should also be had to the policies in this Framework, where relevant . \\n 5. The\\n Fr\\namework does not contain specific policies for nationally significant \\ninfrastructure projects. These are determined in accordance with the decision-making framework in the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and relevant national policy s tatements for major infrastructure, as well as any other matters that are \\nrelevant (which may include the National Planning Policy Framework). National policy statements form part of the overall framework of national planning policy, and may be a material consideration in preparing plans and making decisions on \\nplanning applications.  \\n 6. Other statements of government policy may be material when preparing plans or deciding applications, such as relevant Written Ministerial Statements and endorsed recommendations of the National Infrastructure Commission.  \\n  \\n \\n \\n1  This document replaces the previous version of the National Planning Policy Framework published in \\nFebruary  2019. \\n2  This includes local and neighbourhood plans that have been brought into force and any spatial \\ndevelopment strategies produced by combined authorities or elected Mayors (see G lossary).  \\n3  Section 38(6) of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 and section 70(2) of the Town and \\nCountry Planning Act 1990.

Achieving sustainable development  \\n7. The purpose of the planning system is to contribute to the achievement of \\nsustainable development.  At a very high level, the objective of sustainable \\ndevelopment can be summarised  as meeting the needs of the present without \\ncompromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs4. At a \\nsimilarly high level, members of the United Nations – including the U nited Kingdom \\n– have agreed to pursue the 17 Global Goals for Sustainable Development in the \\nperiod to 2030. These address social progress, economic well -being and \\nenvironmental protection5.  \\n 8. A c\\nhiev\\ning sustainable development means that the planning system has  three \\noverarching objectives, which are interdependent and need to be purs ued in \\nmutually supportive ways (so that  opportunities can be taken to secure net gains \\nacross each of  the different objectives) : \\n \\na) an economic  objective  – to help build a strong, responsive and competitive \\neconomy, by ensuring that sufficient land of the right types is available in the \\nright places and at the right time to support growth, innovation and improved \\nproductivity ; and by identifying and coordinating the provision of inf rastructure;  \\n b) a social objective  – to support strong, vibrant and healthy communities, by \\nensuring that a sufficient number and range of homes can be provided to meet the needs of present and future generations; and by fostering well -designed, \\nbeautiful  and safe  places , with accessible services and open spaces that reflect \\ncurrent and future needs and support communities’ health, social and cultural \\nwell-being; and  \\n c) an environmental objective  – to protect and enhanc e our natural, built and \\nhistoric environment;  including making effective use of land,  improv ing \\nbiodiversity, us ing natural resources prudently, minimis ing waste and pollution, \\nand mitigat ing and adapt ing to climate change, including moving to a low carbon \\neconomy.  \\n 9. These objectives should be delivered through the preparation and implementation of plans and the application of the policies in this Framework; they are not criteria \\nagainst which every decision can or should be judged. Planning policies and \\ndecisions should play an active role in guiding development towards sustainable \\nsolutions, but in doing so should take local circumstances into account, to re flect \\nthe character, needs and opportunities of  each area . \\n 10. So that sustainable development is pursued in a positive way, at the heart of the Framework is a presumption in favour of sustainable development  (paragraph \\n11). \\n \\n \\n \\n4 Resolution 42/187 of the United Nations General Assembly.  \\n5 Transforming our World: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development . \\n \\n ', doc_id='12269bcd-d04b-47b0-923d-2fe098451665', embedding=None, doc_hash='a43c970c964e97a7e6ae27a3ad38ef1fc5fa3d47b71889235cb7903c4421365e', extra_info={'page_label': '5', 'file_name': 'National_policy_July_2021.pdf'}), Document(text=' \\n6 \\n The presumption in favour of sustainable development  \\n \\n11. Plans and decisions should apply  a presumption in favour of sustainable \\ndevelopment.  \\n \\nFor plan- making  this means that:  \\n \\na) all plans should promote a sustainable pattern of development that \\nseeks to : meet the development needs of thei r area; align growth \\nand infrastructure; improve the environment ; mitigat e climate change \\n(including by making effective use of land in urban areas) and adapt \\nto its effects ;  \\n b) strategic policies  should, as a minimum,  provide for  objectively \\nassessed needs  for housing and other  uses , as well as any needs \\nthat cannot be met within neighbouring areas\\n6, unless:  \\ni. the application of policies in this Framework that protect areas or \\nassets of particular importance provides a strong reason for \\nrestricting the overall scale , type or  distribution of  development in \\nthe plan area7; or \\nii. any adverse impacts of doing so would significantly and demonstrably outweigh the benefits, when assessed against the policies in this Framework taken as a whole.  \\n \\nFor decision- taking  this means:  \\n \\nc)  approving development proposals that accord with an up- to-date \\ndevelopment plan without delay; or  \\n \\nd)  where there are no relevant  development plan policies , or the \\npolicies which are most important for determining the application are \\nout-of-date\\n8, granting permission unless:  \\ni. the application of  policies in this Framework that protect areas or \\nassets of particular importance provides a clear  reason for \\nrefusing the development  proposed7; or \\nii. any adverse impacts of doing so would significantly and demonstrably outweigh the benefits, when assessed against the \\npolicies in this Framework taken as a whole.  \\n \\n \\n6 As established through statements of common ground (see paragraph 27). \\n7 The policies referred to are those in this Framework (rather than those in development plans) relating to: \\nhabitats sites (and those sites listed in paragraph 181) and/or designated as Sites of Special Scientific \\nInterest; land designated as Green Belt, Local Green Space, an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, a \\nNational Park (or within the Broads Authority) or defined as Heritage Coast; irreplaceable habitats ; \\ndesignated heritage assets (and other heritage assets of archaeological interest referred to in footnote 68); \\nand areas at risk of flooding or coastal change.  \\n8 This includes, for applications involving the provision of housing, situations where the local pla nning \\nauthority cannot demonstrate a five year supply of deliverable housing sites (with the appropriate buffer, as set out in paragraph 74 ); or where the Housing Delivery Test indicates that the delivery of housing was \\nsubstantially below (less than 75% of) the housing requirement over the previous three years.

The presumption in favour of sustainable development  does not change the \\nstatutory status of the development plan as the starting point for decision- making. \\nWhere a planning application conflicts with an up- to-date development plan \\n(including any neighbourhood plans that form part of the development plan), \\npermission should not usually be granted. Local planning authorities may take \\ndecisions that depart from an up- to-date development plan, but only if material \\nconsiderations in a particular case indicate that the plan should not be followed. \\n 13. The application of the presumption has implications for the way communities engage in neighbourhood planning. Neighbourhood plans should support the delivery of strategic policies contained in local plans or spatial development strategies; and should shape and direct development that is outside of  these \\nstrategic policies.  \\n 14. In situations where the presumption (at paragraph 11d) applies to applications involving the provision of housing , the adverse impact of allowing development that \\nconflicts with the neighbourhood plan  is likely to significantly and demonstrably \\noutweigh the benefits , provided  all of the following apply\\n9: \\na) the neighbourhood plan became part of the development plan two years or less \\nbefore the date on which the decision is made; \\nb) the neighbourhood plan contains policies and allocations to meet its identified housing requirement ; \\nc) the local planning authority has at least  a three year supply of deliverable \\nhousing sites  (against its five year housing supply requirement, including the \\nappropriate buffer as set out in paragraph 74); and \\nd) the local planning authority’s  housing delivery was at least 45% of that \\nrequired\\n10 over the previous three years . \\n  \\n \\n \\n9 Transitional arrangements are set out in Annex 1.  \\n10 Assessed against the Housing Delivery Test, from November 2018 onwards.

Plans should:  \\na) be prepared with the objective of contributing to the achievement of sustainable development\\n11;  \\nb) be prepared positively, in a way that is aspirational but deliverable;  \\nc) be shaped by early, proportionate and effective engagement between plan-\\nmakers and communities, local organisations, businesses, infrastructure providers  and operators  and statutory consultees;  \\nd) contain policies that are clearly written and unambiguous, so it is evident how a decision maker should react to development proposals;  \\ne) be accessible through the use of digital tools to assist public involvement  and \\npolicy presentation; and \\nf) serve a clear purpose, avoiding unnecessary duplication of policies that apply to a particular area (including policies in this  Framework, where relevant).  \\n \\nThe plan-making framework  \\n 17. The development plan must include strategic policies to address each local \\nplanning authority’s  priorities for the development and use of land in its  area\\n12. \\nThese strategic policies can be produced in different ways, depending on the issues and opportunities facing each area. They can be contained in: \\na) joint or individual local plan s, produced by authorities working together or \\nindependently (and which may also contain non-strategic  policies) ; and/or  \\nb) a spatial development strategy produced by a n elected Mayor or combined \\nauthority, where plan -making powers have been conferred.  \\n \\n18. Policies to address non- strategic matters should be included in local plans that \\ncontain both strategic and non- strategic policies, and/or in local or neighbourhood \\nplans that contain just non- strategic policies . \\n 19. The development plan for an area comprises the combination of strategic and non-\\nstrategic policies which  are in force at a particular time . \\n \\n \\n11 This is a legal requirement of  local planning authorities exercising their plan- making functions  (section \\n39(2) of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004) . \\n12 Section 19(1B -1E) of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004.

Plans should make explicit which policies are strategic policies\\n14. These should be \\nlimited to those necessary to address the strategic priorities of the area (and any \\nrelevant cross -boundary issues), to provide a clear starting point for any non -\\nstrategic  policies that are needed . Strategic p olicies should not extend to detailed \\nmatters that are more appropriately dealt with through neighbourhood plans or other non- strategic  policies.  \\n 22. Strategic policies should look ahead over a minimum 15 year period from adoption\\n15, to anticipate and respond to long- term requirements and opportunities, \\nsuch as those arising from major improvements in infrastructure.   Where larger  \\nscale development s such as new settlements or significant extensions to existing \\nvillages and towns  form part of the strategy for the area, policies should be set \\nwithin a vision that looks further ahead (at least 30 ye ars), to take into account the \\nlikely timescale for delivery.16  \\n23.

Local planning authorities and county councils (in two- tier areas)  are under  a duty  \\nto cooperate with each other, and with other prescribed bodies, on strategic matters that cross administrative boundaries.  \\n 25. Strategic policy -making authorities  should collaborate to identify the relevant \\nstrategic matters which they need to address in their plans. They should also engage with their local communities and relevant bodies including Local Enterprise Partnerships, Local Nature Partnerships, the Marine Management Organisation, county councils, infrastructure providers, elected Mayors and  combined authorities \\n(in cases where Mayors or combined authorities do not have plan- making powers).  \\n 26. Effective and on -going joint working between strategic policy -making authorities \\nand relevant bodies is integral to the production of a positively prepared and justified strategy. In particular, joint working should help to determine where additional infrastructure is necessary, and whether development needs that cannot  \\nbe met wholly within a particular plan area could  be met elsewhere.  \\n 27. In order to demonstrate effective and on- going joint working, strategic policy -\\nmaking authorities should prepare and maintain one or more statements of common ground, documenting the cross- boundary matters being addressed and \\nprogress in cooperating to address these. These should be produced using the approach set out in national planning guidance, and be made publicly available throughout the plan- making process to provide transparency.  \\n \\nNon-strategic  policies  \\n 28. Non-strategic  policies should  be used by local planning authorities and \\ncommunities to set out more detailed policies for specific areas, neighbourhoods or types of development. This can include allocating sites, the provision of infrastructure and community facilities at a local level, establishing design principles , conserving and enhancing the natural and historic environment  and \\nsetting out other development management policies.  \\n 29. Neighbourhood planning gives communities the power to develop a shared vision for their area. Neighbourhood plans can shape, direct and help to deliver sustainable development, by influencing local planning decisions as part of the statutory development plan. Neighbourhood plans should not  promote less \\ndevelopment than set out in the strategic policies for the area, or undermine those strategic policies\\n18. \\n 30. Once a neighbourhood plan has been brought into force, the policies it contains take precedence over existing non- strategic policies in a local plan covering the \\nneighbourhood area, where they are in conflict; unless they are superseded by \\nstrategic or non-strategic  policies that are adopted subsequently.  \\n \\n \\n \\n18 Neighbourhood plans must be in general conformity with the strategic policies contained in any \\ndevelopment plan that covers their area.

The preparation and review of a ll policies  should be  underpinned by relevant and \\nup-to-date evidence. This should be adequate and  proportionate, focused tightly on \\nsupporting and justifying the policies concerned, and take into account relevant market signals.  \\n 32. Local plans and spatial development strategies  should be informed throughout their \\npreparation by a sustainability appraisal that meets the relevant legal requirements\\n19. This should demonstrate how the plan has addressed relevant \\neconomic, social and environmental objectives (including opportunities for net gains). Significant adverse impacts on these objectives should be avoided and, wherever possible, alternative options which reduce or eliminate such impacts should be pursued. Where significant adverse impacts are unavoidable, suitable mitigation measures should be proposed (or, where this is not possible, compensatory measures should be considered).  \\n 33. Policies in local  plans and spatial development strategies  should be reviewed to \\nassess whether they need updating at least once every five years, and should then be updated as necessary\\n20. Reviews should be completed no later than five years \\nfrom the adoption date of a plan, and should take into account changing \\ncircumstances affecting the area, or any relevant changes in national policy. Relevant strategic policies will need updating at least once every five years if their applicable local housing need figure has changed significantly ; and they are likely \\nto require earlier review if local housing need is expected to change significantly  in \\nthe near future.  \\n \\nDevelopment contributions  \\n 34. Plans should set out the contributions expected from  development. This should \\ninclude setting out the levels and types of affordable housing provision required, along with other infrastructure (such as that needed for education, health, transport, flood and water management, green and digital infrastructure). Such policies should not undermine the deliverability of the plan.  \\n \\nExamining plans  \\n 35. Local plans and spatial development strategies  are examined to assess whether \\nthey have been prepared in accordance with legal and procedural requirements, and whether they are sound. Plans are ‘sound’ if they are:  \\n \\n \\n \\n19 The reference to relevant legal requirements refers to Strategic Environmental Assessment. \\nNeighbourhood plans may require Strategic Environmental Assessment , but only where there are potentially \\nsignificant environmental effects . \\n20 Reviews at least every five years  are a legal requirement for all local plans  (Regulation 10A of the Town \\nand Country Planning (Local Planning) (England) Regulations 2012) .

Decision -making  \\n38. Local planning authorities should approach d ecision s on proposed development in \\na positive and creative way. They should use the full range of planning tools \\navailable, including brownfield registers and permission in principle, and work proactively with applicants to secure developments that will improve the economic, social and environmental conditions of the area. Decision -makers at every level \\nshould seek to approve applications for sustainable development where possible.  \\n \\nPre-application engagement and front -loading  \\n 39. Early engagement has significant potential to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the planning application system for all parties. Good quality pre-application discussion enables better coordination between public and private resources and improved outcomes for the community. \\n 40. Local planning authorities have a key role to play in encouraging other parties to take maximum advantage of the pre- application stage. They cannot require that a \\ndeveloper engages with them before submitting a planning application, but they should encourage take -up of any pre- application services they offer. They should \\nalso, where they think this would be beneficial, encourage any applicants who are not already required to do so by law to engage with the local community  and, where \\nrelevant, with statutory and non- statutory consultees, before submitting their \\napplications.  \\n 41. The more issues that can be resolved at pre- application stage, including the need \\nto deliver improvements in infrastructure and affordable housing, the greater the \\nbenefits. For their role in the planning system to be effective and positive, statutory planning consultees will need to take the same early, pro- active approach, and \\nprovide advice in a timely manner throughout the development process. This assists local planning authorities in issuing timely decisions, helping to ensure that applicants do not experience unnecessary delays and costs.  \\n 42. The participation of other consenting bodies in pre- application discussions should \\nenable early consideration of all the fundamental issues relating to whether a \\nparticular development will be acceptable in principle, even where other consents relating to how a development is built or operated are needed at a later stage. Wherever possible, parallel processing of  other consents should be encouraged to \\nhelp speed up the process and resolve any issues as early as possible.  \\n 43. The right information is crucial to good decision- making, particularly where formal \\nassessments are required (such as Environmental Impact Asses sment, Habitats \\nRegulations assessment and f lood risk a ssessment). To avoid delay, applicants \\nshould discuss what information is needed with the local planning authority and expert bodies as early as possible.  \\n 44.

Local planning authorities should only request supporting information that is relevant, necessary and material to the application in question.  \\n 45. Local planning authorities should consult the appropriate bodies when considering applications for the siting of, or changes to, major hazard sites, installations or \\npipelines , or for development around them . \\n 46. Applicants and local planning authorities should consider the potential for voluntary planning performance agreements, where this might achieve a faster and more effective application process.  Planning performance agreements are likely to be \\nneeded for applications that are particularly large or complex  to determine.  \\n \\nDetermining applications  \\n 47. Planning law requires that applications for planning permission be determined in accordance with the development plan, unless material considerations indicate otherwise. Decisions on applications should be made as quickly as possible, and within statutory timescales unless a longer period has been agreed by the applicant in writing.  \\n 48. Local planning authorities may give weight to relevant policies in emerging plans according to:  \\na) the stage of preparation of the emerging plan (the more advanced its preparation, the greater the weight that may be given);  \\nb) the extent to which there are unresolved objections to relevant policies (the less significant the unresolved objections, the greater the weight that may be given); and \\nc) the degree of consistency of the relevant policies in the emerging plan to this Framework (the closer the policies in the emerging plan to the policies in the Framework, the greater the weight that may be given)\\n24. \\n 49. However , in the context of the Framework – and in particular the presumption in \\nfavour of sustainable development – arguments that an application is premature \\nare unlikely to justify a refusal of planning permission other than in the limited circumstances where both:  \\na) the development proposed is so substantial, or its cumulative effect would be so significant, that to grant permission would undermine the plan- making process \\nby predetermining decisions about the scale, location or phasing of new development that are central to an emerging plan; and  \\nb) the emerging plan is at an advanced stage but is not yet formally part of the development plan for the area.  \\n \\n \\n \\n24 During the transitional period for emerging plans submitted for examination (set out in paragraph 2 20), \\nconsistency should be tested against the original Framework published in March 2012.

Where planning permission is refused on grounds of prematurity, \\nthe local planning authority will need to indicate clearly how grant ing permission for \\nthe development concerned would prejudice the outcome of the plan- making \\nprocess. \\n \\nTailoring planning controls to local circumstances  \\n 51. Local planning authorities are encouraged to use Local Development Orders to set \\nthe planning framework for particular areas or categories of development  where the \\nimpacts would be acceptable, and in particular where this would promote economic, social or environmental gains for the area.  \\n 52. Communities can use Neighbourhood Development Orders and Community Right to Build Orders to grant planning permission.  These require the support of the local \\ncommunity through a referendum. Local planning authorities should take a proactive and positive approach to such proposals, working collaboratively with community organisations to resolve any issues before draft orders are submitted for examination.  \\n 53. The use of Article 4 directions to remove national permitted development rights should :  \\n \\n• where they relate to change from non- residential use to residential use, be \\nlimited to situations where an Article 4 direction is necessary to avoid wholly \\nunacceptable adverse impacts (this could include the loss of the essential \\ncore of a primary shopping area which would seriously undermine its vitality \\nand viability, but would be very unlikely to extend to the whole of a town \\ncentre)  \\n• in other cases , be limited to situations where an Article 4 direction is \\nnecessary to protect local amenity or the well -being of the area (this could \\ninclude the use of Article 4 directions to require planning permission for the demolition of local facilities)  \\n• in all cases, be based on robust evidence, and apply to the smallest geographical area possible.  \\n54.

Conditions that are required to be discharged before development commences should be avoided, unless there is a clear justification\\n25. \\n 57. Planning obligations must  only be sought where they meet all of the following \\ntests\\n26: \\na) necessary to make the development acceptable in planning terms;  \\nb) directly related to the development; and  \\nc) fairly and reasonably related in scale and kind to the development.  \\n 58. Where up- to-date policies have set out the contributions expected from \\ndevelopment, planning applications that comply with them should be assumed to be viable. It is up to the applicant to demonstrate whether particular circumstances \\njustify the need for a viabi lity assessment at the application stage . The weight to be \\ngiven to a viability assessment is a matter for the decision maker, having regard to all the circumstances in the case, including whether the plan and the viability evidence underpinning it is up to date, and any change in site circumstances since the plan was brought into force.

Effective enforcement is important to maintain public confidence in the planning system. Enforcement action is discretionary, and local planning authorities should act proportionately in responding to suspected breaches of planning control. They should consider publishing a local enforcement plan to manage enforcement proactively, in a way that is appropriate to their area.

Delivering a sufficient supply of homes  \\n60.

To determine the minimum number of homes needed, strategic policies should be  \\ninformed by  a local housing need assessment, conducted using the standard \\nmethod in national planning guidance – unless exceptional circumstances justify an \\nalternative approach which  also reflects current and future demographic trends and \\nmarket signals.  In addition to the local housing need figure, any needs that cannot \\nbe met within neighbouring areas should also be taken into account  in establishing \\nthe amount of housing  to be planned for . \\n 62.

Planning policies and decisions need to reflect changes in the demand for land. They should be informed by regular reviews of both the land allocated for development in plans, and of land availability. Where the local planning authority considers there to be no reasonable prospect of an application coming forward for the use allocated in a plan:  \\na) it should, as part of plan updates , reallocate the land for a more deliverable use \\nthat can help to address identified needs (or, if appropriate, deallocate a site which is undeveloped);  and \\nb) in the interim, prior to updating the plan, applications for alternative uses on the \\nland should be supported, where the proposed use would contribute to meeting an unmet need for development in the area.  \\n 123. Local planning authorities should also take a positive approach to applications for alternative uses of land which is currently developed but not allocated for a specific purpose in plans, where this would help to meet identified development needs. In particular, they should support proposals to:  \\na) use retail and employment  land for homes in areas of high housing demand, \\nprovided this would not undermine key economic sectors or sites or the vitality and viability of town centres, and would be compatible with other policies in this Framework; and  \\nb) make more effective use of sites that provide community services such as schools and hospitals, provided this maintains or improves the quality of service provision and access to open space.  \\n \\nAchieving appropriate densities  \\n 124.

Achieving  well-designed places  \\n126. The creation of high quality , beautiful  and sustainable  buildings and places is \\nfundamental to what the planning and development process should achieve. Good design is a key aspect of sustainable development, creates better places in which to live and work and helps make development acceptable to communities. Being clear about design expectations, and how these will be tested, is essential for achieving this. So too is effective engagement between applicants, communities, local planning authorities and other interests throughout the process.  \\n 127. Plans  should , at the most appropriate level , set out a clear design vision and \\nexpectations, so that applicants have as much certainty as possible about what is likely to be acceptable. Design policies should be developed with local communities so they reflect local aspirations, and are grounded in a n understanding and \\nevaluation of each area’s  defining characteristics.  Neighbourhood planning groups  \\ncan play an important role in identifying the special qualities of each area and explaining how this should be reflected in development , both through thei r own \\nplans and by engaging in the production of design policy, guidance and codes by local planning authorities  and developers .   \\n \\n128. To provide maximum clarity about design expectations  at an early stage, all \\nlocal planning  authorities  should prepare design guides or codes consistent with \\nthe principles set out in the National Design Guide and National Model Design Code, and which reflect local character and design preferences.  Design guides and \\ncodes  provide a local framework for creating beautiful and distinctive places  with a \\nconsistent and high quality standard of design. Their  geographic coverage, level of \\ndetail and degree of prescription should be tailored to the circumstances and scale of change in each  place, and should allow a suitable degree of variety.   \\n 129. Design guides and codes can be prepared at an area- wide, neighbourhood or site -\\nspecific scale, and to carry weight in decision- making should be produced either as \\npart of a plan or as supplementary planning documents. Landowners and developers  may contribute  to these exercises, but may also choose to prepare \\ndesign codes in support of a planning application  for sites they wish to develop .  \\nWhoever prepares them, all guides and codes should be based on effective \\ncommunity engagement and reflect local aspirations for the development of their area, taking into account the guidance contained in the National Design Guide and \\nthe National Model Design Code. These national documents should be used to \\nguide decisions on applications in the absence of locally produced design guides or \\ndesign codes.  \\n  130. Planning policies and decisions should ensure that developments:  \\n \\na) will function well and add to the overall quality of the area, not just for the short term but over the lifetime of the development;  \\n \\nb) are visually attractive as a result of good architecture, layout  and appropriate \\nand effective landscaping;   \\n ', doc_id='5d74a5d5-9010-4bf1-ab8f-8b8a39ca587e', embedding=None, doc_hash='cd52dd348c11c90054d81efcc89c77452adeb29c26a154e00566fc64f03c3202', extra_info={'page_label': '38', 'file_name': 'National_policy_July_2021.pdf'}), Document(text=' \\n39 \\n c) are sympathetic to local character and history, including the surrounding built \\nenvironment and landscape setting, while not preventing or discouraging appropriate innovation  or change (such as increased densities) ; \\n \\nd) establish or maintain a strong sense of place, using the arrangement of stree ts, \\nspaces, building types and materials to create attractive , welcoming  and \\ndistinctive places to live, work and visit;  \\n \\ne) optimise the potential of the site to accommodate and sustain an appropriate amount and mix of development (including green and other public space) and \\nsupport local facilities and transport networks;  and \\n \\nf) create places that are safe , inclusiv e and accessible and which promote health \\nand well -being, with a high standard of amenity for existing and future users\\n49; \\nand where crime and disorder, and the fear of crime, do not undermine the \\nquality of life or community cohesion and resilience. \\n 131. Trees make an important contribution to the character and quality of urban environments , and can also help mitigate and adapt to climate change. Planning \\npolicies and decisions should ensure that new streets are tree- lined\\n50, that \\nopportunities are taken to incorporate trees elsewhere in developments (such as parks and community orchards), t hat appropriate measures are in place to secure \\nthe long- term maintenance of newly -planted trees, and that existing trees are \\nretained wherever possible. Applicants and local planning authorities should work with highways officers and tree officers to ensure that the right trees are planted in the right places, and solutions are found that are compatible with highways \\nstandards and the needs of different users.  \\n  132. Design quality should be considered throughout the evolution and assessment of individual proposals. Early discussion between applicants, the local planning \\nauthority and local community about the design and style  of emerging schemes is \\nimportant for clarifying expectations and reconciling local and commercial interests. Applicants should work closely with those affected by their proposals to evolve designs that take account of the views of the community. Applications  that can \\ndemonstrate early, proactive and effective engagement with the community should be looked on more favourably than those that  cannot.  \\n 133. Local planning authorities should ensure that they have access to, and make appropriate use of, tools and processes for assessing and improving the design of \\ndevelopment. These include workshops to engage the local community, design advice and review arrangements, and assessment frameworks such as Building for \\na Healthy Life\\n51.

Protecting Green Belt land  \\n137. The Government attaches great importance to Green Belts. The fundamental aim of Green Belt policy is to prevent urban sprawl by keeping land permanently open; the essential characteristics of Green Belts are their openness and their permanence.  \\n \\n138. Green Belt serves five purposes : \\na) to check the unrestricted sprawl of large built -up areas;  \\nb) to prevent neighbouring towns merging into one another;  \\nc) to assist in safeguarding the countryside from encroachment;  \\nd) to preserve the setting and special character of historic towns; and  \\ne) to assist in urban regeneration, by encouraging the recycling of derelict and other urban land.  \\n 139. The general extent of Green Belts across the country is already established.  New \\nGreen Belts should only be established in exceptional circumstances, for example \\nwhen planning for larger scale development such as new settlements or major \\nurban extensions. Any proposals for new Green Belts should be set out in strategic \\npolicies , which should:  \\na) demonstrate why normal planning and development management policies \\nwould not be adequate;  \\nb) set out whether any major changes in circumstances have made the adoption of this exceptional measure necessary;  \\nc) show what the consequences of the proposal would be for sustainable development;  \\nd) demonstrate the necessity for the Green Belt and its consistency with strategic policies for adjoining areas; and  \\ne) show how the Green Belt would meet the other objectives of the Framework.  \\n 140. Once established, Green Belt boundaries should only be altered where  exceptional \\ncircumstances are fully evidenced and justified, through the preparation or updating  \\nof plans . Strategic p olicies  should establish t he need for any changes to Green Belt \\nboundaries , having regard to their intended permanence in the long term, so they \\ncan endure beyond the plan period.

Before concluding that exceptional circumstances exist to justify changes to Green Belt boundaries, the strategic p olicy-making authority  should be able to \\ndemonstrate that it has examined fully all other reasonable options for meeting its identified need for development. This will be assessed through the examination of its strateg ic policies , which will take into account the preceding para graph, and \\nwhether the strategy : \\na) makes as much use as possible of suitable brownfield sites and underutilised land;  \\nb) optimises the density of development  in line with the policies in chapter 11 of \\nthis Framework, including whether policies promote a significant uplift in minimum density standards in town and city centres and other locations well served by public transport; and  \\nc) has been informed by discussions with neighbouring authorities about whether they could accommodate some of the identified need for development, as demonstrated through the statement of common ground.  \\n 142. When drawing up or reviewing Green Belt boundaries , the need to promote \\nsustainable patterns of development  should be taken into account . Strategic p olicy-\\nmaking authorities  should consider the consequences for sustainable development \\nof channelling development towards urban areas inside the Green Belt boundary, towards towns and villages inset within the Green Belt or towards locations beyond the outer Green Belt boundary.  Where it has been concluded that it is necessary to \\nrelease Green Belt land for development, plans should give first consideration to land which has been previously -developed and/ or is well- served by public \\ntransport . They should also set out ways in which the impact of removing land from \\nthe Green Belt can be offset through compensatory improvements to the \\nenvironmental quality and accessibility of remaining Green Belt land.  \\n 143. When defining Green Belt boundaries, plans  should:  \\na) ensure consistency with the development plan’ s strategy for meeting identified \\nrequirements for sustainable development;  \\nb) not include land which it is unnecessary to keep permanently open;  \\nc) where necessary, identify areas of safeguarded land between the urban area and the Green Belt, in order to meet longer -term development needs stretching \\nwell beyond the plan period;  \\nd) make clear that the safeguarded land is not allocated for development at the present time. P lanning permission for the permanent development of \\nsafeguarded land should only be granted following an update to a plan which \\nproposes the development;  \\ne) be able to demonstrate  that Green Belt boundaries will not need to be altered at \\nthe end of the plan period; and  \\nf) define boundaries clearly, using physical features that are readily recognisable and likely to be permanent.  \\n ', doc_id='215f7091-c2cc-4083-9ae7-17718af01a95', embedding=None, doc_hash='ed7abea2215f9453a390ada5edf81330ac9cdc268474193434372aa6aba84010', extra_info={'page_label': '42', 'file_name': 'National_policy_July_2021.pdf'}), Document(text=' \\n43 \\n 144. If it is necessary to restrict development in a village primarily because of the \\nimportant contribution which the open character of the village makes to the openness of the Green Belt, the village should be included in the Green Belt. If, however, the character of the village needs to be protected for other reasons, other means should be used, such as conservation area or normal development \\nmanagement policies, and the village should be excluded from the Green Belt.  \\n 145. Once Green Belts have been defined, local planning authorities should plan positively to enhance their beneficial use, such as looking for opportunities to provide access; to provide opportunities for outdoor sport and recreation; to retain \\nand enhance landscapes, visual amenity and biodiversity; or to improve damaged and der elict land.  \\n 146. The National Forest and Community Forests offer valuable opportunities for improving the environment around towns  and cities, by upgrading the landscape \\nand providing for recreation and wildlife. The National Forest Strategy and an approved Co mmunity Forest Plan may be a material consideration in preparing \\ndevelopment plans and in deciding planning applications.

The Plan will also facilitate the delivery of more affordable housing for local people. The Plan reinforces the Council’s long held ambition for town centre regeneration. It sets out a strategy to create a new and more vibrant community that boosts shops and services, and provides new public quaysides along the harbour edge. The Plan will also take the first steps in establishing the Stour Valley Park, a new public open space that will in time extend from Wimborne to Christchurch, creating a valuable recreational resource and a connected off road walking and cycling route.\\nThe Poole Local Plan embraces the Council’s corporate priorities of:  •\\n promoting the health and well-being of our population especially the \\nmost vulnerable;\\n•\\n ensuring all children and young people have the chance to achieve their full potential;\\n•\\n promoting Poole’\\ns economic growth and regeneration by attracting \\ninvestment in business, housing and jobs for all; and\\n•\\n protecting and enhancing Poole’\\ns beautiful environment in a \\nsustainable way so that it is a great place to live, work and play. \\nThe proposals in the Poole Local Plan will by 2033 have created over 9,000 new permanent jobs in Poole, boosting productivity of the Poole economy by £332m per year. There will be an estimated cost saving to the public purse of £3.2m per year from reducing unemployment and enabling people to live healthier lives. \\nManaging traffic congestion is a key requirement to help accommodate \\ngrowth. Considerable thought has gone into providing a package of measures to improve accessibility to services through encouraging better travel choices and a reduction in reliance upon the car, building on our past success.\\nWe would like to thank the local community for contributing to the \\npreparation of this Plan. We feel that this Plan represents a pragmatic approach to the balance of development and protection of the environment that we value so highly. Development undoubtedly brings pressures and difficulties, but it also presents us with opportunities. The \\nchallenge for the Council is to manage development so that we can meet the needs of present and future generations.

The following form part of Poole’s statutory development plan:\\nBournemouth, Dorset and Poole Minerals \\nStrategy (2014)  sets out the vision, objectives and \\npolicies for mineral extraction in Bournemouth, Dorset and Poole. For Poole, it identifies safeguarded areas in the north of Poole to prevent sterilisation of mineral deposits from development. These are shown on the Policies Map. \\nThe Bournemouth, Dorset and Poole Minerals \\nSites Plan is at examination and identifies sites for future minerals development.\\nBournemouth, Dorset and Poole Waste Local \\nPlan (2006) identifies sites for the treatment and disposal of waste, and provides criteria to determine planning applications for proposed \\nPoole Local Plan 3\\nwaste management facilities. Allocated waste sites in Poole are shown on the Policies Map.\\nThe plan will be replaced by a new waste local \\nplan which is at examination.\\nMarine Planning\\n1.9 The Marine Management Organisation (MMO) is a non-departmental public body responsible for the management of England’s marine area on behalf of the UK government. The MMO’s delivery functions are; marine planning, marine licensing, wildlife licensing and enforcement, marine protected area management, marine emergencies, fisheries management and issuing European grants.\\n1.10 As the marine planning authority for England \\nthe MMO is responsible for preparing marine plans for English inshore and offshore waters. Marine plan boundaries extend up to the level of the mean high water mark, which means that there will be an overlap with terrestrial plans that generally extend to the mean low water mark. Marine plans will inform and guide decision makers on development in marine and coastal areas. The MMO has published marine plans for the South Inshore and South Offshore Marine Plan Areas, which includes Poole. \\n1.11 To ensure that all the regulations are \\nfollowed, all public authorities taking authorisation or enforcement decisions that affect or might affect the UK marine area, must make reference to the MMO’s licensing requirements. They must also \\nView across Canford Cliffs to Sandbankshave regard to any relevant Marine Plans or where a marine plan is not currently in place, the Marine Policy Statement in accordance with the Marine and Coastal Access Act (MCAA) 2009.\\nRelationship to other Strategies\\n1.12 The Poole Local Plan has been informed by a range of evidence and supporting plans and strategies including: \\nPoole’s Corporate Strategy (2015-2019 ) sets \\nout the Council’s priorities including promoting \\neconomic growth and regeneration by attracting investment in business, housing and jobs for all, protecting and enhancing the town’s beautiful environment in a sustainable way so that it is a great place to live, work and play, and promoting the health and well-being of Poole’s population.\\nThe Bournemouth, Poole and Dorset \\nLocal Transport Plan (2011-2026) sets out \\nBournemouth, Poole and Dorset County Council’s objectives and proposals for achieving a safe, reliable and accessible low carbon transport system. Key proposals include the provision of strategic infrastructure, sustainable transport and minimising the amount that people need to travel.\\nThe Dorset Local Enterprise Partnership \\nStrategic Economic Vision  for 2033 envisages \\nPoole, Bournemouth and the surrounding urban area as home to internationally competitive sectors including advanced engineering and manufacturing and financial services.

Prepared by the Poole Partnership through engagement with local people and organisations it included the aspiration for a successful economy, a revitalised town centre, valuing Poole’s world class environment, and ensuring better health and well-being for everyone. \\nPoole’s Economic Development Strategy \\n(2014-2019) sets out the Council’s ambition to \\nsecure sustainable economic growth for Poole. A key objective is to facilitate the delivery of infrastructure, transport, housing and key sites. To achieve this the Strategy promotes connectivity by road, rail and broadband, delivering more housing and affordable housing, allocating and safeguarding employment generating sites, and protecting and enhancing retail centres.\\nThe Bournemouth and Poole Health and Well-\\nbeing Strategy (2016-2019)  identifies health \\npriorities and sets out a framework for improving health and well-being whilst the Joint Strategy Needs Assessment (JSNA) sets out how the Local Authority, work together with the NHS and other public sector partners in Dorset to understand the health and well-being needs of the local population.\\n1.13 These strategies and all evidence referred \\nto in this Plan can be viewed on the Council’s website. \\nDuty to Cooperate\\n1.14 The Council in preparing this Local Plan, has worked closely on strategic matters with other Councils including those in the Eastern Dorset Housing Market Area (HMA), the Dorset Local Enterprise Partnership (DLEP), the Dorset Local Nature Partnership (DLNP) and other prescribed bodies when developing the Poole Local Plan. This is to ensure that economic aspirations and housing needs will be met with the delivery of cross boundary strategic infrastructure, in balance with the protection of the setting of Poole and its European and internationally important sites.  1.15 The Council will continue to work with the other relevant Councils as they prepare their own local plans. With local government reorganisation taking place to create two unitary authorities in Dorset, one focussed on the conurbation  Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole and the other on the rest of Dorset, there will be less Councils involved in the Duty to Cooperate. \\nFuture Review\\n1.16 The evidence base demonstrates that a careful approach to mitigating impact on European and internationally important sites will be required in order for Poole’s development needs to be accommodated. Sufficient investment in key infrastructure to combat identified issues such as traffic congestion, flood defences and supporting community facilities will also be needed. Delivering the strategy will therefore require ongoing monitoring and review to ensure that the planned development will be accommodated sustainably.\\n1.17 Therefore, the Council will review the Poole \\nLocal Plan by 2023, or the new unitary authority will prepare a local plan for the new administrative area, to ensure that the overall strategy remains up to date and on target to meet the full objectively assessed needs by the end of the plan period. \\n1.18 A key part of the evidence base for the \\nplanned review will be an assessment of the impact of growth since 2006 upon European and internationally important sites. This assessment will provide a clearer picture as to whether the planned mitigation measures are being effective and if no adverse harm has been caused to habitats.\\n1.19 The Local Transport Plan will also continue \\nto set out the strategy for addressing traffic congestion and promoting sustainable forms of travel to support growth across the South East Dorset conurbation. These ongoing pieces of evidence will be crucial in planning the future growth of South East Dorset.  \\n1.20 An earlier review of the Poole Local Plan may \\nbe necessary if monitoring shows that needs are not being met as currently envisaged in this Plan.

This enables residents to gain access to a much greater range of services and jobs than otherwise might be expected for a town of Poole’s size. The conurbation is well-placed on the central south coast to develop economic links with both the South West and South East.\\n2. Characteristics of Poole\\nPoole is a diverse and vibrant town on the south coast of England.  It extends \\nfrom Poole Harbour in the south to the Stour river valley in the north, covering a total area of 25 square miles.\\n  1 Key economic statistics for Poole and Bournemouth (2018)2.2 Poole benefits greatly from its coastal \\nlocation and setting on the shores of one of the world’s largest natural harbours. The surrounding environment is a key asset, with the Jurassic Coast World Heritage Site, the New Forest, and the Isle of Purbeck all within 10 miles of Poole. These are great attractions, but the town offers much more besides. It is rich in history and is a working town and sea port, with a successful and diverse local economy.\\n2.3 Since 1945 Poole has experienced \\nconsiderable change and was one of the fastest-growing urban areas in the country. The designation of a Green Belt in 1980 halted the outward expansion of the town. In recent years, the housing and economic recession and the growing recognition of the environmental value of heathland, has resulted in a further slowing-down of house building rates to about half those experienced in the peak years. \\nA precious environment\\n 2.4 Poole Harbour and areas of lowland heathland are internationally protected habitats. The Harbour is of ecological, recreational and commercial importance, a balance which is a key characteristic of the town. Canford Heath provides Poole’s largest single fragment of Dorset heathland. Heathland is sensitive to human activity and new housing development can lead to cumulative impacts upon these valuable habitats. There is a legal duty to protect the Harbour and heathlands, and so the Council has to demonstrate that future development can take place without causing harm.\\nRiver Stour at Canford School Poole town centre', doc_id='7aaa5a74-cc2a-4557-bc6f-5becd087dbaa', embedding=None, doc_hash='aa316c2e6530371fab4f2baea4ecf9f1dd98e79334ae3a066584a24ce23e2099', extra_info={'page_label': 'b5', 'file_name': 'poole_local_plan.pdf'}), Document(text='    Poole Local Plan      6\\n Figure 3: The location of Poole on the south coast© Crown Copyright and database right 2018. \\nOrdnance Survey 1000124248.', doc_id='a7c24ef5-8016-4eec-99bb-387b9362f9fc', embedding=None, doc_hash='3da1c3cbd9c3c4850f3d5edd43233b9e3b3eac9875e0079df9cefc5899aecd27', extra_info={'page_label': 'b6', 'file_name': 'poole_local_plan.pdf'}), Document(text='Poole Local Plan 7\\nFigure 4: The Borough of Poole\\n  2 Key economic statistics for Poole and Bournemouth (2018)A distinctive town\\n \\n2.5 Poole’s built and archaeological heritage is the result of a long and distinct history. Key features include diverse architectural styles, formal parks and gardens, historic suburbs, an ancient quay and Georgian old town to the south, Canford Manor and Stour river valley to the north, the grounds of three country houses and a town centre peninsula that projects into the Backwater Channel that divides Holes Bay from the Harbour. Hence Poole as a whole is distinctive but is also composed of smaller distinctive areas.  2.6 Poole  Harbour and the sea provides an exceptional setting \\nfor the town with seafront promenades, pavilions and beach huts dating back to the 1930s which are highly valued by residents and visitors alike. Views of Old Harry Rocks, where the Jurassic World Heritage Coast designation begins, are among the natural features that make Sandbanks beach a desirable location. The Harbour played a key role in the defence of Britain and in the development of aviation history and has marine archaeology that is of national significance.\\n \\nA working town\\n 2.7 Poole is a working town with 71,000\\n2 people in employment. As \\na key trading port on the south coast, Poole’s early development as an industrial and manufacturing centre was based on shipping, boat building, fisheries, pottery and ceramic design and manufacture, brick-making, iron foundries and breweries. Physical reminders of this development are evident throughout the built environment and are increasingly important in creating a narrative of local life and maintaining Poole as a distinctive place.  2.8 Today, Poole has a strong, diverse economic base.

It \\ncontains a wide range of retail, leisure, transport links, commercial, open spaces and housing that come together to make a distinct and diverse community. The proximity to the Harbour and historic Old Town and Quay give the town centre an attractive setting. \\n3.2 Regenerating Poole town centre is a key \\ncorporate priority for the Council. The town centre has excellent public transport links and large areas of development land with significant potential to become a more attractive, dynamic heart of the town. Regeneration opportunities exist across the town centre, as illustrated in Figure 5. \\n3.3 A key focus of Poole’s growth continues to be \\nthe redevelopment of brownfield land in the town centre to deliver significant improvements to the appearance and function of Poole.  Although some good progress has been made in regenerating the town centre, overall delivery has remained slow due to the lasting effects of recession and cost of redeveloping complex sites.\\n3.4 In addition, the cost of redeveloping brownfield \\nland and implementing flood defences affect the amount of affordable housing that can be delivered in the town centre.

Furthermore Poole’s largest brownfield opportunity, the Former Poole Power Station is now a Government Housing Zone, highlighting the underlying potential in the town centre.\\n3.6 A number of brownfield opportunities lie on \\nthe waters edge of Poole Harbour. The Harbour is an internationally important site for wildlife and therefore the challenge for new development is to ensure, through careful design of any buildings, that there is no harm to wildlife in the Harbour. \\n3.7 Poole town centre comprises the town’s main \\nretail offer with the Dolphin Centre, Poole High Street and the Quay. However, traditional store-based shopping is facing new challenges with the growth of internet sales, subdued forecasts for consumer spending following the economic recession and increases in discount retailers. Retailers and other town centre occupiers are also more selective in terms of the space they occupy and in which towns they choose to locate.\\n3.8 There is still a role for store-based shopping. \\nHowever, a major challenge for Poole town centre is to modernise and diversify the town centre, to offer a broad range of retail, leisure, cultural and civic services in a welcoming environment to enable residents to have multiple reasons to visit and spend more time there.  3.9 Forecasts identify a need for 14,500 sq. m of additional comparison retail space to be provided by 2024\\n3. As retail needs will change over time due \\nto increases in on-line shopping and other forms of shopping, it is the Council’s intention to review retail forecasts and apply these for the remainder of the plan period. It has also been identified that people are likely to spend more time and income on commercial leisure such as cafés, bars, restaurants and cinemas. This can be positive for Poole, as residents and visitors will spend longer in the town centre and increase footfall outside of retail hours. In addition to catering for the needs of a new town centre community there is the opportunity to reinvigorate the evening economy of the town centre through the provision of restaurants, bars and possibly a cinema to complement existing attractions such as the Lighthouse.\\n3.10 A key challenge will therefore be ensuring that \\nregeneration of the town centre can deliver a mix of housing and commercial development to retain its existing role and function and have a significant contribution to meeting needs over the plan period.\\n3.11 Currently, the Town Centre Heritage \\nConservation Area appears on Historic England’s ‘Heritage at-Risk’ Register, which emphasises that the urban quality of the town centre must be improved as part of the overall regeneration strategy. Significant growth coming forward in the town centre will place additional pressure on heritage assets. In particular proposals for tall buildings within the setting of the  conservation area  \\nwill need to be carefully considered. In a climate \\nof reduced public funding for heritage assets the Council will need to work with its various partners to enhance the Town Centre Heritage Conservation Area in order to remove it from the ‘Heritage at-Risk’ Register.\\n3.12 A further challenge is enhancing connectivity \\nacross the town centre to bring the various individual areas together to create a new sense of place for residents and visitors. For example, the cultural offer in Poole is split between Town Centre North and the Quay, but it is perceived that the long linear High Street connecting the two areas has a negative impact on linked trips. Major roads and the railway also break up spaces and connectivity to key areas within the town centre. \\n3Poole and Purbeck Town Centres, Retail and Leisure Study (2014)Poole town centre ', doc_id='0f96d6bd-4b6d-44f6-8af0-14900bc3cfc8', embedding=None, doc_hash='f964ef0681f907427838531536107b1256c870f02e6060d00aed908bcf93e456', extra_info={'page_label': 'b11', 'file_name': 'poole_local_plan.pdf'}), Document(text='Poole Local Plan123.13 Poole is part of the Eastern Dorset \\nHousing Market Area (HMA) with Bournemouth, Christchurch, East Dorset, North Dorset and Purbeck Councils, Figure 6. The Eastern Dorset Strategic Housing Market Assessment (SHMA) identifies an ‘objectively assessed housing need’ (OAHN) for the HMA of 57,600 homes over the period 2013 to 2033\\n4. Poole’s contribution to this \\nis a minimum of 14,200 homes (710 homes per year), which is a significant increase over the previous Core Strategy housing requirement of 10,000 for the period 2006 to 2026 (500 homes per year).\\n3.14 It is also important that the right type of \\nhomes are provided to ensure needs are met in Challenge 2: Meeting all housing needs\\nfull. The SHMA identifies that for Poole there is a need to provide homes suitable for families to help address affordability and the housing needs of an ageing population. \\n3.15 The Poole Core Strategy envisaged that \\ndelivery would be front loaded with 7,600 homes provided in the period 2006-2016. However, due to the late 2000s recession and the sustained impact on the housebuilding industry only 4,371 homes were built in this period. By 2016 average completions had still not reached the Core Strategy target of 500 dwellings per year. \\n3.16 It is evident that a step change in delivery \\nis required to meet Poole’s housing needs over the plan period. Identifying sufficient land supply is only one aspect of meeting needs and the Council will need to engage with its partners, developers and government organisations in order to increase build rates over the plan period to a consistent level sufficient to meet the overall plan requirement. This approach will, however, take some time to realise in terms of the delivery of new homes.\\n3.17 It is also a challenge finding suitable land in \\nPoole to meet housing needs with opportunities for outward expansion tightly constrained by the sea, environmental designations as well as the Green Belt. There are limited opportunities for major new sites in the urban area due to its compact form, conservation areas and the need to retain sufficient employment land and community infrastructure. Making the best and most efficient use of urban land is crucial, although care will need to be taken in terms of density and design to protect the character of Poole. Brownfield sites may also have wildlife value and the need for surveys to assess the ecological value may limit development in some instances.  Furthermore, \\nthe demand to live in Poole means that 6% of the housing stock is classed as a second home adding pressure to the supply of housing.  \\n3.18 There is no identified need for the Council \\nto provide residential pitches for Poole’s gypsy and traveller population that meet the planning definition\\n5. However, there is a need for 4 pitches \\nby 2033 for gypsies and travellers that do not meet the planning definition. These 4 pitches will need to be met through traditional housing or through opportunities such as ‘self- build’.   3.19 There is demand for plots for ‘self-build’ and ‘custom-build’ homes in Poole, and therefore sites will be needed to enable people to build their own home\\n6.

As a result, housing affordability, measured using the lower quartile house price to lower quartile income ratio is 9.8 compared to an average across England of 7.1, highlighting ongoing, acute affordability issues in Poole\\n7. Challenge 3: Addressing the widening affordability gap \\n3.21 651 affordable homes have been delivered between 2006 and 2018.  This is significantly below the Core Strategy target of 2,450 over the same period. The Council is concerned that this trend may continue due to the slow recovery from the economic recession and changes to national policy and guidance as to how viability is considered when determining planning applications. The Council has found it difficult to secure affordable housing through cross-subsidy from market housing, despite the latest viability evidence\\n8 showing that sites are viable \\nto contribute towards the Council’s preferred affordable housing target and tenure mix. The Council itself is making progress in delivering affordable housing on Council owned land with 94 new homes recently built and 156 more homes under construction. \\n3.22 The SHMA recognises that due to the poor \\naffordability of housing in Poole the need for affordable housing has significantly increased since the Core Strategy was adopted. The SHMA identifies that Poole now has a need to provide 660 affordable dwellings per annum. This figure does not readily translate into the OAHN and will have to be met through a range of measures, some of which fall outside the remit of planning. Therefore the SHMA recommends increasing Poole’s housing target from the demographic forecasts of 665 homes per year to 710 homes per year, equating to a 7% uplift, to help address affordability issues. \\n7Key Economic Statistics For Poole And Bournemouth (2018)\\n8Poole Viability Assessment (2017)\\nFigure 7: Average house prices in Poole between 1998 and 2016 (data from HM Land Registry 2017)\\n', doc_id='b6220e66-776b-4fdb-a88b-8c780a9610f4', embedding=None, doc_hash='d8f52d9fddf2d1d725cc86a0d83c5db577afa667855c1d91bdbd6bb0be6b78e1', extra_info={'page_label': 'b13', 'file_name': 'poole_local_plan.pdf'}), Document(text='Poole Local Plan143.26 The Dorset Workspace Strategy10 identifies \\na ‘step change scenario’ of 2.4% growth across \\nthe HMA, for the plan period 2013 to 2033, creating 36,000 full-time equivalent (FTE) jobs.

The step change scenario includes a 20% allowance to provide flexibility in the range and choice of sites available to the market. Of this forecast growth, 33.1ha of additional employment land is identified to come forward in Poole.Challenge 4: Providing care \\nfor an ageing population3.27 Poole’s Economic Development Strategy11  \\nidentifies a number of challenges to achieving \\neconomic growth. Challenges include constrained road and rail infrastructure that impacts on connectivity and speed, an ageing population, a low proportion of residents with higher skills levels, a net outward migration of young people in the 15-24 age group (particularly those with graduate skills), and worsening affordability of housing with contrasting low wages and high house prices. \\n3.28 Added to these challenges, Poole and the \\nwider south-east Dorset conurbation are likely to be affected by competition from Southampton and other parts of South Hampshire, where ambitious growth plans could see a concentration of economic investment, with a resultant net increase in out-commuting. With traditional manufacturing forecast to continue to decline, a key challenge will \\nChallenge 5: Stimulating \\neconomic growth\\n3.23 Poole’s demographic profile is generally \\nolder than the national average  with over 22% of \\nPoole residents over the age of 65, compared with 15.9% in England. Population forecasts for Poole indicate that this could increase significantly (40%) by 2033, with the population of people over the age of 85 expected to nearly double. In addition, Poole is a popular retirement destination, with net in-migration of approximately 660 people over the age of 55 during 2012-2014.\\n3.24 In response, the Council has identified a \\nneed\\n9 for 3,425 specialist homes by 2033 to meet \\nthe needs of an ageing population as part of the overall housing target of 14,200 homes. In addition to the overall housing target, 816 care home bed spaces will be required (323 residential care and 493 nursing home bed spaces). \\n3.25 A key challenge for Poole in planning for an \\nageing population will be to maximise opportunities for independent living, staying healthy and access to appropriate care facilities and services for elderly residents.\\n9Needs assessment of the future need for specialist housing and support services for older people in Poole (2016)\\n10Bournemouth, Dorset and Poole Workspace Strategy (2016)\\n11Poole’s Economic Development Strategy and Action Plan: 2014-2019\\nFigure 8: Employment distribution by sector in East Dorset (ONS 2015)Wholesale and retail trade\\nHuman and health and social work activitiesManufacturingEducationAccommodation/Food servicesTourism and LeisureProfessional, scientific and technical activitiesAdvanced manufacturing/ engineeringCreative Industries\\n', doc_id='4115b749-06f2-4551-88ba-16709e4d03bb', embedding=None, doc_hash='0576912b3ae45fb12c527552842012b5599f450adc608215dacba99310b92e49', extra_info={'page_label': 'b14', 'file_name': 'poole_local_plan.pdf'}), Document(text='Poole Local Plan153.32 Congestion and unreliable journey times can \\nprejudice economic success and development, as well as harm the environment and air quality. Congestion in South East Dorset is getting worse and recent opinion surveys in Poole reveal that local people indicate increasing levels of concern over the rise in local traffic and resultant congestion. Poole’s challenge in the future is to manage economic and population growth in order to deliver economic and social well-being whilst managing congestion.\\n3.33 As part of a long-term Local Transport Plan \\nStrategy, the Council is, in partnership, addressing congestion with significant recent investment in strategic schemes including the Twin Sails Bridge, enhancements to the A35 and investment in public transport on main routes connecting Poole, Bournemouth and Christchurch.\\n3.34 Following investment in public transport \\ninfrastructure and improvements in bus frequency and service quality, Poole has had the largest percentage increase in bus patronage over the last decade across England. This is an achievement that must be built on in order for Poole to accommodate further growth without resulting in unacceptably high levels of congestion.   3.35 Forecasts suggest that without mitigation by the end of the plan period growth in vehicle trips from existing and planned growth in Poole Challenge 6: Reducing the need to travel while managing traffic \\ngrowth\\ncould potentially increase by 34% on 2012 \\nlevels, highlighting potential for greater levels of congestion. The Local Transport Plan already includes a number of measures to promote sustainable transport and behavioural change which will come forward in any event to mitigate against this predicted increase.  Meeting future housing and economic requirements will add further pressures to a congested network that will require these measures to be further expanded. Modelling of the new allocations identified in the Poole Local Plan will, before mitigation generate 2.5% vehicle trips in addition to the 34% increase\\n12. \\n3.36 In terms of mitigation options, it is evident that more must be done to reduce the need to travel, as well as promoting sustainable forms of travel to reduce reliance on the private car. Furthermore, government policy, physical limitations and environmental designations reduce the potential for new roads and limit the ability to widen roads and junctions to absorb greater levels of car traffic. Park and Ride has been partly implemented, but is not yet economically viable to implement on a daily basis. In addition, despite having a cross-conurbation railway line with multiple stations there is not a regular short distance service. The challenge going forward will be to influence travel behaviours by providing a better choice of attractive, safe and convenient sustainable transport alternatives to the private car.\\nbe to reverse this trend and grow the engineering and manufacturing sector (figure 8).\\n3.29 An important part of regenerating the town \\ncentre is to provide jobs in addition to housing in the most accessible part of the town. However, developers have found it difficult to deliver speculative office accommodation in Poole as the returns are inadequate compared to the cost of construction as well as the need to provide sufficient car parking, which can be difficult to provide in town centre locations. \\n3.30 As referred to under Challenge 1 another \\nkey challenge is to embrace changes to shopping habits and reinvigorate the role of the town centre as a commercial leisure centre and boost both the daytime and evening economy to provide benefit in terms of a more attractive lifestyle. Parts of Poole’s town centre have been established as a Business Improvement District (BID), this will help by         re-investing in the town centre and improving the customer experience.  \\n3.31 There may be a rebalancing of the office \\nmarket as oversupply of older accommodation is converted to housing through permitted development rights introduced by government in 2013. There may still be a role for modern office accommodation that meets todays IT requirements with reduced overheads, (e.g. heating and maintenance) that can contribute to boosting the economy within the town centre. The challenge will be how to secure such commercial development in redeveloping brownfield sites where viability has proven difficult in recent years. \\n12 Poole Local Plan Transport Study (2017) \\n', doc_id='6f834b73-7d08-49fa-85b7-a8af908692cb', embedding=None, doc_hash='f131388f73dd67d7183c775014cd1b419370fff65ad0f376229084f6aff787bb', extra_info={'page_label': 'b15', 'file_name': 'poole_local_plan.pdf'}), Document(text='Poole Local Plan163.37 Despite Poole’s attractive setting, and outwardly prosperous \\nimage from internationally known areas such as Sandbanks, pockets of deprivation remain. Seven of Poole’s 91 Lower Super Output Areas are in the worst national quartile for Multiple Deprivation, Figure 9. These are located in Hamworthy, Alderney, and Poole Old Town. Challenges include an ageing population, income deprivation, housing inequalities, unhealthy lifestyles, tackling air pollution from traffic congestion, social exclusion and upgrading outdated housing stock.\\n3.38  Adaptation to climate change is embedded into national and local \\npolicy. Some of the predicted consequences of global warming particularly relevant to Poole are the expectation of hotter, drier summers and warmer, wetter winters, as well as a forecast 1.3 metres rise in sea level by 2133. The forecast sea level rise would put 4,000 properties in Old Town at risk of flooding. Much of Poole, particularly the coastline, is sheltered from the excesses of weather by a mature tree canopy. Trees are often under pressure from infill development within Poole, and as trees age new trees will need to be grown to ensure the protections remain.  \\n3.39 As a coastal town the approach of the shoreline management plan\\n13  is \\nto largely ‘hold the line’ and to maintain and upgrade or replace defences. \\nThe exception to this approach is in the area of Ham Common and north Holes Bay, where the strategy will be not to invest in the provision or maintenance of defences and to allow the coastline to selectively retreat over the long term. Raising flood defences is expensive, with no certainty of future public funding for maintenance. This additional cost is proving a challenge to the delivery of town centre regeneration, with developers struggling to make development schemes viable.Challenge 7: Improving health and tackling \\npockets of deprivation\\nChallenge 8: Preparing for climate change\\n13Poole and Christchurch Bays Shoreline Management Plan (2011) (SMP2)Figure 9: Areas with highest index of multiple deprivation in Poole \\n(ONS 2015)\\n© Crown Copyright and database right 2018. \\nOrdnance Survey 1000124248.', doc_id='b1c10a72-636e-421d-8a04-f8817dd5832a', embedding=None, doc_hash='5a87fddb09c04fd9efe2c66398b97bd4eca3973e284ece787d2f83461dec6feb', extra_info={'page_label': 'b16', 'file_name': 'poole_local_plan.pdf'}), Document(text='Poole Local Plan173.45 Much of the future growth is likely to come \\nforward through the intensification of development within the urban area. The Council’s challenge is to ensure that this new development is successfully integrated with its local context.

It is also important to retain wildlife corridors linking urban heaths to wider countryside. Challenge 10: Carefully \\nmanaging growth to maintain Poole’s local distinctiveness 3.40 Evidence shows that the cumulative impact \\nof a growing population can cause adverse effects upon Poole’s green infrastructure, in particular European and internationally important sites such as the Dorset Heathlands and in Poole Harbour\\n14. \\n3.41 The Dorset Heathlands cover an extensive area of South East Dorset fragmented by urban development and other land uses. The Council as decision maker has concluded that development in the area around protected sites is required to provide avoidance or mitigation measures. This approach is supported by Natural England who advise that the cumulative effect of a net increase of homes up to 5 kilometres from protected heathland in Dorset would have a significant effect on Dorset’s lowland heaths. Avoidance measures or mitigation are required otherwise the Council cannot grant planning permission for new homes. \\n3.42 Increasing nitrogen levels from sewage and \\nagriculture are adding to the growth of algal mats in Poole Harbour, smothering estuarine habitats and thereby restricting the growth, distribution and variety of food available for internationally protected bird species.

Maintaining this natural habitat that includes internationally important bird populations against man made pressures requires a strategic approach to balance the diverse needs of different user groups from those in boats to dog walkers, shellfish harvesters and bait diggers.

Proposals for the town centre are shown in Figure 11. \\n4.10 A key component of the strategy is to direct the majority of \\ndevelopment to the most accessible and sustainable parts of the Poole. The most accessible locations in Poole are: \\n•\\n the town centre, \\n•\\n district centres, \\n•\\n local centres and neighbourhood parades, \\n•\\n existing employment areas; and \\n•\\n locations close to sustainable transport corridors*\\n* For the purpose of this Plan, areas close to sustainable \\ntransport corridors are defined as those parts of Poole within 400 metres walk of locations that are served or capable of being served over the plan period by a frequent bus service (at least 4 buses per hour) and/or 500 metres of a railway station. \\n4.1\\n1 These areas are shown on the Key Diagram and the \\nPolicies Map and are discussed in further detail in Chapter 10. \\nWithin these areas the majority of higher density development will be encouraged, subject to compliance with other policies in the plan (e.g. local character), to place a greater number of \\nFigure 10: Key Diagram\\n', doc_id='2995c856-c9ae-4a61-af8e-786ac5a6bea6', embedding=None, doc_hash='17d6a3576b6801218dc31008c707e2ac7dc8157aefb3d4b87b79bd10e1a85413', extra_info={'page_label': 'b24', 'file_name': 'poole_local_plan.pdf'}), Document(text='Poole Local Plan25people within close walking distance of public transport, as a \\nconvenient alternative to use of the car. \\n4.12 The flexible approach to higher density development, \\nas set out in this Plan, aims to encourage a wider range of developers to bring forward new homes to the market than has been the case previously within Poole. Care will need to be taken in terms of density, design and the generation of traffic to ensure that the focus remains on directing development to the most sustainable areas first. \\n4.13 Elsewhere in the urban area, i.e. outside of the \\nmost accessible locations listed, there is still potential for development to come forward and contribute towards meeting housing needs. The Council encourages the redevelopment of brownfield land in these areas so long as the development, including flatted schemes, will contribute to creating sustainable mixed communities. \\n4.14 In all cases and in order to minimise the potential for \\nadditional congestion, the Council will require the developer to be pro-active in incorporating sustainable transport measures, such as travel plans, access to bus stops, increasing bus service frequencies, providing additional car clubs vehicles/ultra low emission vehicles, pedestrian and cycle facilities.\\n4.15 Employment growth should be focussed by redeveloping \\nvacant sites within existing employment areas that are already well served by sustainable transport. Office development will be focussed in the town centre and at Talbot Village, accompanied by incubator units to help retain graduates and skills in IT/creative media.\\n4.16 Poole town centre will be the focus for retail and \\ncommercial leisure growth.

However, despite maximising \\ndensities and providing a more flexible policy approach to enable more development to come forward in the urban area, the Council still expects a shortfall in meeting housing needs of approximately 1,300 homes. The Council has also identified a need for new school places being potentially required later in the plan period, that is unlikely to be accommodated in the urban area. \\n  \\n     Poole Local Plan 26centres will also offer a range of local shops and services to support the day to day needs of nearby residents, and will be accessible by cycling, walking and public transport. \\nOptimising the use of land  \\n4.17 As Poole is tightly constrained by the sea, \\nenvironmental designations and Green Belt, making the best and most efficient use of urban land is crucial, particularly in the town centre and the most accessible locations in Poole. The Council has identified some minimum indicative densities that new housing should aim to meet and where appropriate, exceed. \\n4.18 There will be occasions where achieving such \\ndensities is not possible for a number of reasons that will differ on a site by site basis. These could include the proposed mix of uses on the site, protection of garden land, the setting of heritage assets or to ensure that the development respects the character of the locality. This is a crucial issue outside of the most accessible areas, where there are conservation areas characterised by low density development such as Branksome Park. Therefore no minimum density has been set for ‘elsewhere in the urban area’ and each site will be assessed on a site by site basis to ensure local character is respected. \\nPoole’s Green Belt \\n 4.19 The South East Dorset Green Belt was first designated in 1980 and since then has been successful in preventing the joining up \\nof settlements and in maintaining an area of open land around the conurbation. Government continues to attach great importance to maintaining the openness of Green Belt land. By restricting outward growth, the Green Belt has also helped to focus investment towards the re-use of previously developed land in the urban area. \\n4.20 This is of particular significance in Poole \\ngiven the Council’s ambitions for the regeneration \\nExceptional circumstances\\n• T o provide land to achieve the full OAHN and other uses, which are integral to the strategy of \\nmaintaining a balanced community and supporting sustainable patterns of development. \\n•\\n T\\no boost delivery of housing and address past issues of deliverability within the urban area. \\n•\\n T\\no significantly boost affordable housing supply. \\n•\\n T\\no provide a balanced mix of housing types to meet all needs by (i) providing homes suitable \\nfor families and plots for self/custom build that tend not to result from intensification of the urban \\narea; and (ii) care homes.  \\n•\\n T\\no provide enough homes to sustain Poole’s workforce.    \\n•\\n The opportunity to deliver significant areas of new public open space including delivering the first phases of the Stour V\\nalley Park concept, which could have longer term heathland mitigation \\nbenefits for all of Poole.  \\n•\\n Other local authorities within the housing market area are unable to help towards Poole’\\ns \\nhousing needs.  \\n•\\n The areas identified for removal from the Green Belt have been assessed as part of the Green Belt Review\\n. While the sites are confirmed as meeting some of the purposes of Green Belt, the \\nreview identified that their loss would not harm the overall strategic function of the wider South East Dorset Green Belt.\\n Figure 12: Summary of the exceptional circumstances for Green Belt release', doc_id='12948b8c-11ca-43eb-bf1d-c88b154cc5ee', embedding=None, doc_hash='c0c23465816f50b47ed91d7a5b2a092dc8dcd4786b48635fa52135a29b14d0eb', extra_info={'page_label': 'b26', 'file_name': 'poole_local_plan.pdf'}), Document(text='Poole Local Plan2715Poole Local Plan Issues and Options – Summary of Representations (2016)\\n16Poole Green Belt Review (2017)\\n4.21 The Council as part of the preparation of the Poole Local \\nPlan consulted upon three options of how to meet the OAHN, including needs for families and affordable homes. The preference of respondents was a balanced approach combining increased densities within the urban area and expanding the town outwards through the release of land from the Green Belt\\n15. \\n4.22 Government policy allows Councils to alter the Green Belt boundary in exceptional circumstances through the preparation or review of the local plan. The Council undertook a Green Belt Review\\n16 that assesses the role and function of the South East \\nDorset Green Belt in Poole. 4.23 In addition to the Green Belt Review the Council considers there are, in accordance with national policy, exceptional circumstances to release some land from the Green Belt to help meet housing needs, Figure 12.\\n4.24 To meet the full needs over the plan period, the Council has \\namended the boundary of the Green Belt to accommodate the shortfall of 1,300 homes. The shortfall will be met through the provision of a minimum of 800 homes to the north of Bearwood and a minimum of 500 homes north of Merley. These are illustrated as strategic urban extensions in Figure 13 and are covered in more detail in Chapter 6. This growth strategy is considered to be the most sustainable approach and in accordance with the findings of the Green Belt Review. \\n4.25 Land is also released from the Green Belt at Creekmoor \\n(Site  A1) and Canford School (Site A2) to ensure there is sufficient land to meet education needs by the end of the plan period. Whilst the primary reason for the release of land at Creekmoor is for education purposes, it is logical to also release the adjacent smaller parcels of land to the east, which are largely previously developed. One of these smaller parcels, land at Roberts Lane \\nFigure 13: Proposed development at Merley and Bearwood© Crown Copyright and database right 2018. \\nOrdnance Survey 1000124248.Urban area\\nUrban allocationStrategic urban extensionEducation allocationStrategic open spaceProposed SANGGreen BeltLand added into Green Belt\\nNote: The strategic open space are \\nalso within the Green Belt', doc_id='665bef3c-7276-4aa3-b385-f6f383101f9f', embedding=None, doc_hash='318c1d63af3fdd6cd683a81646a15a13023c958588b890e18b07c66d83a788e8', extra_info={'page_label': 'b27', 'file_name': 'poole_local_plan.pdf'}), Document(text='Poole Local Plan28\\nFigure 14: Location of Green Belt release at Creekmoor \\n(site U14) is allocated for housing for around 45 homes.

The new Green Belt boundary has been drawn closely around the built form of the main school campus to minimise any loss of openness; or any reduction in the strategic gap between Merley/Canford Magna and the large built-up area of the conurbation at Bearwood. This is shown in Figure 29, page 72.\\n4.26 The Poole Local Plan also adds a significant area of land \\nto the Green Belt south of Bearwood to help strengthen the long term function of the Green Belt beyond the plan period.

This will include bringing forward Suitable Alternative Natural Greenspace (SANGs) at Upton Country Park and on other suitable sites. The two strategic urban extensions will also deliver SANGs, which combined will form important pieces of the new Stour Valley Park, a concept of connected public open space between Wimborne and Bearwood as illustrated by Figure 33 on page 84.

It is important to ensure that development within the wider town centre geography supports and complements the Council’s corporate aspirations to transform and revitalise the town centre.   Poole Quays Forum Neighbourhood \\nPlan\\n5.5 Poole Quays Forum has prepared a \\nneighbourhood plan for part of the town centre. The neighbourhood plan area is shown on the Policies Map. The neighbourhood plan has been adopted and forms part of the statutory development plan.  Therefore the policies within the Poole Quays Forum Neighbourhood Plan will also be applicable to town centre proposals that fall within the neighbourhood plan area. \\nTown centre strategy\\n5.6 The town centre contains a number of vacant and underused sites which offer huge potential to deliver a wide range of development. In addition, there are numerous areas where targeted projects could help to enhance the overall environment and bring about positive change.

There are also significant areas of brownfield land available for development. Therefore, Poole town centre is the most appropriate location for the most intensive uses and highest densities, which means it will continue to be the principal focus for major development in Poole.\\n5.8 Due to the amount of potential redevelopment \\nland available, the town centre is a key focus for meeting housing needs over the plan period. The town centre has capacity to deliver around 6,000 homes by 2033 (42% of the total housing requirement) thus highlighting its importance to the overall strategy for meeting Poole’s needs.  \\n5.9 In addition to delivering a significant proportion \\nof housing need, there will be an emphasis on delivering improved and better integrated retail and commercial leisure attractions that enhance consumer choice and encourage people to visit the town centre more often and stay longer. This will happen alongside an expanded residential population and additional employment uses necessary to securing a mix of uses and improve vitality.  \\nFigure 15: Town centre strategy© Crown Copyright and database right 2018. \\nOrdnance Survey 1000124248.Railway\\nRoadsHigh StreetWaterside route\\n', doc_id='e0b9d5b4-e708-4ea0-87cf-b48394d32b29', embedding=None, doc_hash='4e978e22094be6b97e9eb6b1b89e741515e6472f47dd72ee4951b2577b5b6a80', extra_info={'page_label': 'b33', 'file_name': 'poole_local_plan.pdf'}), Document(text='Poole Local Plan345.10 Forecasts17 identify a need for circa. \\n14,500sq. m of additional comparison retail space \\nto be provided by 2024. To support sustainable patterns of development and the regeneration of the town centre, this additional floor space should be located within the town centre. Whilst the Council will work with developers to deliver new retail space where opportunities arise, there also remains an immediate need to improve the existing retail offer across the town centre. \\n5.11 Existing vacancy rates are relatively high \\nand the market demand for new retail space has been low in recent years, particularly within the High Street.  There is also a lack of appropriately sized units to meet modern occupiers’ needs. Therefore, to address this the Council encourages the enhancement and better utilisation of existing vacant space within the town centre. The Council will also continue to work with its partners under other regeneration initiatives to deliver an overall enhanced town centre environment and experience to create a stronger retail market that will help attract new retail investment to ensure needs are met over the plan period.  Main town centre uses should be located within the Poole town centre boundary with retail uses directed to the primary shopping area unless specifically allocated elsewhere. \\n5.12 As the speculative office market has been \\nweak in recent years and the demand for office space is typically for smaller units, additional B1 office space will be provided across the allocated sites as part of mixed-use developments.5.13 In terms of location, the majority of growth will be focused across two strategic locations Town Centre North and on sites around the Twin Sails Bridge as illustrated by Figure 15. Town Centre North is the most sustainable location in terms of proximity to the bus and rail station and should be the focal point for major mixed-use development comprising residential, retail, leisure, and office uses. \\n5.14 The sites around Twin Sails Bridge will deliver \\nnew homes and commercial uses that support the town centre and open up new leisure routes along the waterfront.  5.15 There is also an important role for the High Street, Old Town and the Quay, by contributing to the overall regeneration of the town centre. In these areas the Council will encourage a range of town centre uses to support their long term viability in conjunction with the major development proposals at Town Centre North and Twin Sails. The High Street in particular requires investment to enhance its function within the town centre and providing an attractive and vibrant link between Town Centre North, Twin Sails and the Quay. \\n5.16 To be successful, town centre regeneration \\nwill need to happen in the context of a strong place-making agenda that secures a high quality environment and celebrates the town centre’s rich heritage. It will be vital to ensure new development is of high quality design to complement the area’s strongest features and lead to a significantly improved urban environment. As part of the place-making agenda, the Council will work with developers and its partners to improve connectivity across the town centre and improve access for pedestrian and cycle users within an overall improved urban setting.   5.17 A key focus over the plan period will also be to significantly enhance the setting of the Town Centre Heritage Conservation Area and work with partners to remove it from Historic England’s ‘Heritage at-Risk’ Register. All new development within the setting of the conservation area should be focused on delivering enhancements to the heritage assets, through good design and sensitive use of materials and street furniture. 5.18 The Old Town area of Poole town centre is at risk of tidal flooding from future sea level rise. The Twin Sails regeneration sites are required to deliver the remaining strategic flood defences that will protect the Old Town for over one hundred years, to 2133. Completion of the defences is therefore reliant upon the development of these sites and the Council will continue to work with developers to overcome viability concerns, unlock the sites and thereby deliver regeneration and complete the town centre flood defences. \\n5.19 The Council will produce masterplans \\nand maintain a Town Centre SPD to provide further guidance regarding the form and type of development required to deliver a transformed and revitalised town centre. These will be updated as required to act as an evolving guide for development in the town centre. \\n17Poole and Purbeck Town Centres, Retail and Leisure Study (2014)', doc_id='fa076282-cf85-4d9e-8d91-4091e128a5a0', embedding=None, doc_hash='8284f146241df13f7243b6bb844611dba3638f5374581d1862117e5e602dd3d7', extra_info={'page_label': 'b34', 'file_name': 'poole_local_plan.pdf'}), Document(text='Policy PP3\\nPoole town centre strategy\\nPoole town centre, as defined on the Policies Map, will be the most \\nsuitable location for the most intensive uses and major developments which generate the highest levels of activity.

The area, as illustrated in Figure 16, contains many of the town’s important facilities such as the main railway and bus stations, the Dolphin Shopping Centre, The Lighthouse Centre for the Arts, The Dolphin Swimming Pool and Poole Stadium. However, the overall quality of the environment, the lack of pedestrian and cycle connectivity and appearance of some of the buildings and spaces contributes to negative perceptions of Poole. The Dolphin Centre creates a physical barrier to pedestrian and cycle movement, particularly in the evening and at night. Taking any opportunities to enhance the routes through and around the building should therefore be an important component of any relevant development proposals. The redevelopment of key sites could transform the role and quality of the area and the town centre as a whole. \\n5.21 Town Centre North contains Poole’s primary \\nshopping area and as such will be the focus for retail, and leisure uses. The introduction of a residential population into this area, along with additional office space would further add to vibrancy and vitality. Place-making is essential in this area in order to achieve a high standard of design and a people focused environment with active frontages and stronger pedestrian connections between key facilities. \\nFigure 16: Town Centre North regeneration area© Crown Copyright and database right 2018. \\nOrdnance Survey 1000124248.Area boundary \\nBus stationRailway stationDevelopment sitePriority area for public realm improvementHigh StreetPotential to enhance pedestrian connectionRailwayRoadWaterside routeLevel crossing\\n', doc_id='fb6db9d0-1e2d-41d9-9c52-3cdfccfc267b', embedding=None, doc_hash='145a54346a15d942a2ca97afd1fe3d9c2ffe5be8f87efa26ee40c72bc3ed6d59', extra_info={'page_label': 'b36', 'file_name': 'poole_local_plan.pdf'}), Document(text='Poole Local Plan37\\nPolicy PP4\\nTown Centre North regeneration area\\nTown Centre North will be rejuvenated as the vibrant heart of the town with this area being the \\nfocus for major new residential, retail, commercial leisure and office development.  \\n(1) Uses\\nAll strategic development proposals should provide a mix of uses, which on sites T1 – T6 \\nare consistent with the requirements detailed below and which on other sites could include residential, retail/leisure, office and other commercial development appropriate to the size and location of the site. \\n(2) High Street level crossing\\nProposals affecting, and in the vicinity of, the level crossing must: \\n (a) retain a clear visual connection along the High Street;\\n (b) ensure a physically connected \\nTown Centre North for pedestrians and cyclists to the \\n \\n High Street;\\n (c) preserve or enhance the \\nTown Centre Heritage Conservation Area;\\n (d) provide adequate space to accommodate high pedestrian footfall; and\\n (e) provide adequate vehicular access to Falkland Square .\\n(3) W\\nalking and cycling\\nAll development proposals should contribute towards enhancing pedestrian and cycling \\nmovement in the town centre, improving pedestrian connectivity and provide active frontages along public routes.

Whilst the delivery of some of these sites has begun, others remain vacant and provide a major opportunity to regenerate this part of the town centre. \\n5.27 The largest site within the Twin Sails \\nregeneration area is the Former Poole Power Station, which was awarded Government Housing Zone status in 2015 in recognition of its importance as a strategic housing site. Housing Zone status has resulted in positive partnership working with the landowners and enables greater access to funding that will help resolve delivery issues and bring the site forward over the plan period. 5.28 Together the Twin Sails sites will strengthen the role of the town centre by providing new homes and transforming the waterfront with an extended public quayside. The area provides a critical link to the Port which remains one of Dorset’s most important employment sites. As such there is a need to balance the requirements of providing access to the Port with the need for a well-connected and attractive town centre.\\n5.29 The layout and design of development \\nproposals on these sites will be an important aspect of their success.

The Conservation Area is identified on Historic England’s ‘Heritage at-Risk’ Register and the decline in traditional retailing along the High Street has created a low value trading environment. This combined with the long linear nature of the High Street results in a dis-connect between the cultural offer of the Quay’s and the retail offer of Town Centre North. \\n5.32 The heritage status limits opportunities for \\nsignificant change, however the management of the commercial environment and the public realm, along with the design of new development that does take place, will be important to enable this area to evolve in a way that ensures its continued success. Whilst development must take place sensitively in this area with due regard to its heritage setting, there is still some potential to provide new housing and supporting uses in this area, particularly at the Quay Thistle and Poole Pottery sites as well as around Skinner Street, Lagland Street and Hill Street. Carefully designed development within this area will help to improve the overall function and vitality of this part of the town centre. \\n5.33 The approach for this area is therefore to allow flexibility in building uses to retain active commercial ground floor uses but encourage good design in terms of shop fronts, signs, buildings and public realm to improve perceptions of the area and embrace heritage as a unique asset for the town centre. Funding bids to external organisations and internal projects can be pursued to enhance the historic fabric of the area and deliver environmental improvements.  The Council will adopt and maintain a management plan to enable various community groups and organisations to work together to improve the area and remove it from the English ‘Heritage at-Risk’ Register.

To ensure all needs are met this chapter sets out policies covering boosting supply, affordable housing, homes for an ageing population, multi generational housing, student housing and pitches for gypsies and travellers. These policies should enable more sites to come forward for development for a wider range of house builders and developers including custom/self builders. To meet these needs will require the joint effort of the Council, its partners and the development industry 6. Meeting all housing needs\\nThis chapter sets out policies to ensure the housing needs of local people are met, \\nso Poole remains a balanced and mixed community. Providing housing affordable to local people is crucial to enable young people to grow up and remain living in Poole. In addition, there is a need for more family homes and plots for people to build their own homes. Meeting the needs of an ageing population through the provision of a wide variety of specialist housing can free up family homes whilst enabling older residents to find the ‘right size’ of home for their needs.\\nprovide a minimum of 40 homes. These urban \\nallocations, along with town centre allocations, make up almost a half of total housing supply required to meet the OAHN.  \\n6.5 Much of Poole’s historic delivery has been \\nthrough windfall, which are new homes brought forward by the market on sites not allocated by the Council. Windfall is an important part of supply in predominantly urban areas and over the last 30 years the rate of windfall in Poole has been steadily increasing. The average for the last 12 years which takes into account market conditions pre and post-recession has been 342 homes per year.\\n6.6 The urban capacity work that supports this \\nPlan identifies there is potential for windfall to remain an important part of supply over the plan period. To further assist with maintaining windfall delivery, this Plan adopts a more flexible approach to the location of higher density development such as flats. However, \\nCarters Quay in Poole', doc_id='5cdd6b0a-52e8-44df-9658-b505e8584cee', embedding=None, doc_hash='b4fa8e435ce858d0d2d537f7eb8d94283a490cf2400ff43ded700e628747ad2d', extra_info={'page_label': 'b43', 'file_name': 'poole_local_plan.pdf'}), Document(text='Poole Local Plan44as the Council cannot guarantee that windfall will \\ncontinue to come forward at past rates, this Plan sets a pragmatic allowance of 150 homes per year from this source, which will contribute about 15% of the overall housing supply.\\n6.7 The Council has also identified sites that \\nare suitable for housing in principle, as set out in the SHLAA. These sites are not allocated in the Poole Local Plan for a number of reasons. These reasons could be that the sites are under 40 homes, or sites that were refused planning permission but could still deliver some housing through a revised scheme. To ensure the OAHN is met these sites will be required to provide at least 975 homes which is 7% of the total supply.\\n6.8 Even with this proactive approach to bringing \\nforward more brownfield land there are, however, insufficient deliverable brownfield sites within the urban area to meet Poole’s OAHN of 14,200 \\n18Duty to Co-operate Statement (2017)\\n19Eastern Dorset Strategic Housing Market Assessment (2015)\\n20Poole Viability Study (2017)homes. The Council has identified brownfield capacity will deliver around 12,900 homes, which leaves a shortfall of around 1,300 homes against the OAHN. As part of the Duty-to-Cooperate, the Council has asked the other Councils within the Eastern Dorset HMA if they have any suitable sites to meet this shortfall\\n18. Each Council confirmed \\nthat there is no spare capacity on land outside of the Green Belt across the HMA to meet Poole’s housing shortfall. Therefore as set out in Chapter 4 the shortfall will be met through strategic urban extensions to the North of Merley and North of Bearwood. \\n6.9 Figure 19 breaks down the different forms of \\nsupply that contribute to delivery of a minimum of 14,200 homes. \\n6.10 The likelihood is that the majority of urban \\nredevelopment will be flats, in contrast to the need to provide homes suitable for families as recommended by the SHMA\\n19. The viability work \\nthat supports the plan20 acknowledges that viability \\nis particularly tight in the town centre and securing affordable housing in the future from market schemes in this area will continue to prove difficult.  \\nHousing delivery\\n 6.11 To meet Poole’s housing needs it is evident that a step change in delivery is required. Identifying sufficient land supply is one element and the Council will need to engage with its partners, developers and government organisations in order to increase build rates over the plan period to a consistent level sufficient to meet the overall plan requirement. \\n6.12 Due to Poole’s physical and environmental \\nconstraints and time taken to recover from the recent recession, this Plan sets out a phased approach to housing delivery, to ensure that required interventions to boost delivery rates are given time to work as well as the wider Poole market adapting to the demands of meeting the full OAHN. This approach will, however, take some time to realise in terms of the delivery of new homes. \\n6.13 For the period 2013 to 2018 the target \\ntherefore remains the Core Strategy target of 500 homes per year, on the basis that in Poole only a local plan review can realistically release more land to meet needs. For the next five years of the plan period (2018 to 2023) the target is increased to 710 homes per annum in line with the SHMA, \\nSource No. of homes Proportion of supply\\nCompletions 1,687 12%\\nCommitments 1,593 11%\\nUrban allocations In the town centre 4,380 31% \\nOutside the town centre 2,165* 15% \\nStrategic urban extensionsNorth of Bearwood 8009%North of Merley 500\\nUrban area identified sites 975  7%\\nWindfall allowance 2,100 15%\\nTotal 14,200 100%\\n*Comprises allocations from Policy PP9: Urban allocations outside the town centre and PP21: Talbot Village \\nFigure 19: Housing supply in Poole (minimum net figures) at 1 April 2018', doc_id='b265b45c-b2df-469c-a0f6-50167fd65143', embedding=None, doc_hash='18ee81d8a19de4da430a2f0e90b418c3e7c2ba4ae919a7f50413ecf2ad5f2479', extra_info={'page_label': 'b44', 'file_name': 'poole_local_plan.pdf'}), Document(text='Poole Local Plan45during which time new allocations are expected \\nto be brought forward to facilitate an immediate boost in supply. \\n6.14 The 2018 to 2023 period also will provide \\ntime for the Council to work with its partners to achieve a long-term step change in the delivery of housing in Poole and crucially plan for and implement new strategic mitigation projects to ensure that the planned higher growth will not have a negative effect upon European and internationally important sites.

The red line represents the minimum annual housing target. As shown in the trajectory current commitments (sites already with planning permission) play an important role in boosting supply initially until the strategic allocations come forward. To boost supply and meet the higher housing target, some delivery will be required from the strategic urban extension sites within the first five years following adoption of the Local Plan and for the remainder of the plan period.

The SHMA indicates that all sizes of new market and affordable homes are required in Poole as set out in Figure 21, with 2-3 bed market housing and 1-2 bed affordable housing most needed. As a guide, single persons and couples are likely to require 1 and 2 bedroom properties, while multi-person/family households are likely to require 3 and 4+ bedroom properties.\\n6.17 The SHMA also identifies the type of housing \\nthat is needed, again recognising a need for all types of homes as set out in Figure 22. Whilst flats comprise only a third of housing market needs, the balance is broadly 50% houses and 50% flats for affordable housing.\\n6.18 Council research\\n21 indicates that 23% of \\ndemand for new builds emanates from people \\nwishing to move into a smaller property, most of whom are over 65 years of age. Hence, the building of flats in suitable locations will help to free up family homes in established residential areas. With 70% of all market housing need for houses rather than flats, the strategic urban extensions will make an important contribution to the supply of family housing. In addition, it will be important to retain sufficient levels of family housing stock. This is important not only in meeting the balanced housing needs of Poole but also in promoting strong community development by recognising that character is influenced by how places function as well as their design.Policy PP8\\nType and mix of housing\\nAs a mix of all housing types and sizes are needed in Poole and in order to provide flexibility , \\nother than where prescribed for some of the allocations in this Plan, the Council does not prescribe a particular housing mix development should follow.

Some sites are Council owned and will be developed for housing, provided that the existing facility is relocated to alternative accommodation as part of a general upgrading of Council facilities. \\n6.20 Turlin Moor (N) (site U1) is Council owned \\nland and currently used as playing fields. The Council is proposing to relocate the playing fields onto adjacent informal open space and will be designed to avoid flooding in order to secure  better \\nquality playing fields. Turlin Moor is a large social housing estate and a pocket of deprivation. A development of approximately 400 homes could re-invigorate the estate, enable estate renewal, provide new and enhance existing community facilities and address pockets of deprivation. To mitigate the impact on the adjacent Poole Harbour and heathland, the remaining informal open space would be laid out as a local nature reserve with paths laid out to provide circular walks to promote health and well-being. The strategy for re-providing existing facilities on the developable area will require re-location into land to the west designated as Green Belt. The Council recognise that a pragmatic approach is required in order to deliver the overall concept and accepts that very special circumstances may exist for some of the proposed uses that will require re-location into the Green Belt.\\n6.21 West of Bearwood (site U2) was previously \\nsafeguarded for employment uses. The landowner is now seeking to develop a mixed use site of employment and housing. The site has planning permission for employment uses and for the purposes of this Plan is categorised as an urban allocation. The mixed use scheme can provide 5 hectares of employment, a minimum of 300 homes and contribute towards the delivery of a SANG, although care will be needed to ensure that the employment and housing developments are sympathetic to each use. The SANG can form part of the wider Stour Valley Park concept.  \\nSite U1 Turlin Moor (N)6.22 The Council offices are currently based at the Civic Centre (site U3). However, as part of local government reorganisation the Council by 2033 may seek to move to a new office building. This would allow re-development and conversion of the current offices into flats, similar to the adjacent Police Station redevelopment, with new build development on the Annex site and surface car park. Overall the redevelopment of the site could provide a minimum of 250 new homes adjacent to Poole Park. \\n6.23 There are a range of smaller sites allocated \\nacross Poole that will play an important part in meeting needs over the plan period. These sites include making provision for meeting care needs and where there is potential to provide care homes this has been identified. Previously developed land off Roberts Lane (site U14) has been removed from the Green Belt, as part of a wider release to deliver a new school south of Creekmoor (site A1). This site contains a builders yard and adjacent fields and could deliver around 45 homes, with walking and cycling access to nearby facilities.  \\n6.24 The Council has only allocated sites that \\ncould provide a minimum of 40 homes and are known to be deliverable within the plan period.

The uplift in value of undeveloped greenfield land to a housing use can provide multiple community benefits. In particular, as greenfield sites are generally more viable than urban sites, they can often provide policy compliant levels of affordable housing. To deliver these community benefits, the Local Plan allocates two strategic urban extensions for housing development that necessitate a change to the boundary of the Green Belt; (i) North of Merley and (ii) North of Bearwood as shown in Figure 13 on page 27.   \\n6.26 As demonstrated in this Plan and supporting \\nevidence, there are exceptional circumstances (Figure 12) to alter the Green Belt boundary. Therefore, as part of this, the Council will only grant planning permission for these sites where they secure 40% affordable housing, although the Council will support and encourage proposals that deliver a greater proportion of affordable housing. In addition, these housing sites will enable improved public access to the countryside through the provision of SANGs and help to realise the strategic cross-boundary ambition of delivering the Stour Valley Park concept. The SANGs will remain as Green Belt, with the significant benefit of public access to improve health and well-being of local residents and divert visitor pressure from the Dorset Heathlands.  6.27 It is also important to ensure that development of the strategic urban extensions does in turn not have an adverse effect on the delivery of Poole’s major brownfield opportunities in the town centre. The Council will therefore work with the developers of the strategic urban extensions to ensure that the phasing of development occurs in a measured way over the plan period. \\n6.28 The Council expects that North of Merley \\nand the urban allocation West of Bearwood (Site U2) will be developed between 2018 and 2023, and then North of Bearwood to start delivering completions from 2023 an due built out by 2033. At all times the Council will expect the developers of the strategic urban extensions to demonstrate through the submission of a housing market study that the grant of planning permission or reserved matters of their sites would deliver the required benefits and not result in significant adverse impacts to the delivery of Poole’s strategic town centre sites.\\n6.29 The strategic urban extensions will provide a \\nmix of homes, with a focus on family housing. The schemes must incorporate some custom/self-build plots commensurate with identified need on the Council’s register. To meet the needs of an ageing population there is the opportunity to provide care homes and specialist housing. This would enable existing residents to move into more suitable homes (‘right size’) whilst remaining living within their local community, thereby freeing up larger family homes. 6.30 The Council may prepare additional guidance for the sites such as development briefs, prepared in consultation with the local community to support delivery of high quality strategic urban extensions \\nSite UE1 North of Merley ', doc_id='2ffa2a63-7b9e-40f3-8037-64300b3e6795', embedding=None, doc_hash='2b301202230de71035f287d3f0155eff36880e98b8e53e9fd090349fdc788fa5', extra_info={'page_label': 'b51', 'file_name': 'poole_local_plan.pdf'}), Document(text='Poole Local Plan52Policy PP10\\nStrategic urban extensions\\nThe Council has amended the boundary of the South East Dorset \\nGreen Belt to deliver a minimum of 1,300 homes at:\\n•\\n north of Bearwood; and \\n•\\n north of Merley\\n.\\nPlanning permission on these sites will only be granted where the scheme:\\n(a) delivers 40% affordable housing on-site; \\n(b) provides a mix of housing types with a focus on housing \\nsuitable for families, properties that enable local residents to ‘right-size’, specialist housing for an ageing population and provision of custom/self build plots; (c) demonstrates that the grant of planning permission would not result in significant adverse impacts to the delivery of the town centre’s major brownfield allocations; (d) would implement mitigation measures to ensure no adverse impact upon European and internationally important sites, and includes green corridors for biodiversity;  (e) provides a SANG* that connects with other parts of the Stour Valley Park concept, designed in accordance with the Dorset Heathlands SPD; (f) prioritises sustainable transport measures to facilitate cycling and walking for short trips within the new community, and linking with infrastructure to Poole, Bournemouth and Wimborne centres; (g) ensure the design of the scheme is capable of forming part of a sustainable transport corridor in terms of bus, cycling and walking access;\\n(h) in conjunction with wider strategic mitigation measures to be \\nimplemented by local authorities, provides suitable mitigation to address unacceptable impacts on the highway network;\\n(i) makes a contribution towards the required additional school \\ncapacity;\\n(i) provides space for business start-ups/incubator units; \\n(k) provides a contribution to upgrading a local doctor’s surgery;\\n(l) provides a suitable level of play equipment and other facilities \\nin accordance with Poole’s Open Space Needs Assessment and Playing Pitch Strategy; \\n(m) incorporates structural landscaping to create a strong \\npermanent and defensible Green Belt boundary; and \\n(n) has been prepared through a master planning exercise with \\nthe local community to inform a design code to be agreed by the Council.\\n* Prior to occupation of the first home, the SANGs will need to be implemented, opened to the public and an agreement made with the Council over the future management \\nand monitoring.', doc_id='45f2d7db-7547-45ba-870a-8626ddfea97b', embedding=None, doc_hash='7fddfb300910b99725d15a2a04d4d26e17ed63776ebeeef5e96d9d0b6e47e54a', extra_info={'page_label': 'b52', 'file_name': 'poole_local_plan.pdf'}), Document(text='Poole Local Plan53UE1 North of Merley\\n•\\n A\\n minimum of 500 homes and a minimum of a 60 bed care \\nhome\\n•\\n Small scale incubator/business-start ups in and around the \\nfarm buildings that preserves or enhances the Oakley Lane Conservation \\nArea\\n•\\n Preserves or enhances the setting of the Canford Magna and Oakley Lane Conservation \\nAreas and the listed buildings \\ntherein, including enhancement of the Carriage Drive and its heritage assets\\n•\\n Make a contribution \\ntowards the implementation of a sustainable \\ntransport corridor between the site and Poole and Wimborne\\n•\\n Highway improvements to Oakley Lane, including the junction with the B3073 at the Willett \\nArms Public House and the junction \\nwith Magna Road\\n•\\n A\\n public car park to service local community facilities at Canford \\nMagna and the SANG\\nUE2 North of Bearwood\\n•\\n A\\n minimum of 800 homes and a minimum of a 60 bed care \\nhome\\n•\\n A\\n community hub that forms the heart of the community \\nincorporating proportionate shopping and community facilities \\nrequired to support the creation of the new community\\n•\\n Make a contribution \\ntowards the implementation of a sustainable \\ntransport corridor between the site and Poole/Bournemouth town centres\\n•\\n A\\n second vehicular access from Magna Road, to the east of \\nKnighton Lane\\n•\\n Preserves or enhances the integrity of Knighton hamlet and its heritage assetsthat will integrate with existing communities.

The Council’s strategy is to maximise affordable housing delivery from viable sites over the plan period alongside exploring other opportunities to maximise the delivery of affordable housing. Therefore, the Council is setting a minimum target of 3,000 homes to be provided as affordable housing by 2033. To achieve this, the Council will aim to secure affordable housing on sites of eleven or more homes, in accordance with Government’s nationally prescribed threshold. \\n6.33 Due to vastly different land values across Poole, and in order \\nto maximise the provision of affordable housing, the Council will use different affordable housing targets for different parts of Poole. In Poole town centre, due to the challenges and costs of delivery, the Council will require 10% affordable housing. In the rest of Poole the Council will require 40% affordable housing; these areas are shown in Figure 23. The Council will support and encourage proposals that deliver a greater proportion of affordable housing over and above the policy requirements.\\n6.34 Currently the Council’s housing tenure mix is 70% affordable \\nrent and 30% intermediate housing. The Council is aware that government intends to broaden the definition of affordable housing to include starter homes and rent-to-buy. The Council may therefore consider other affordable housing tenures outside of those set out in policy and other affordable housing products, which will be negotiable on a site-by-site basis, where it:  \\n•\\n improves development viability; \\n•\\n takes into account local needs; and  \\n•\\n contributes to balancing local housing market provision. \\n \\n6.35 \\nThe Council will support affordable housing delivery by ', doc_id='081e7f65-5b58-411d-a169-b530bfd14eb0', embedding=None, doc_hash='79be716ced8c00bef5e0b6d5662abe1daa1b0acddbec8354fd446d0ef6481c9d', extra_info={'page_label': 'b54', 'file_name': 'poole_local_plan.pdf'}), Document(text='Poole Local Plan55maintaining an up-to-date Affordable Housing SPD.   \\n6.36 All affordable housing must remain at an \\naffordable price for future eligible households or for the subsidy to be recycled for alternative housing provision.

For the intermediate housing, this includes ensuring that shared ownership and shared equity products are affordable to those in intermediate housing need.  \\n6.37 For sites of 21 units and above, the provision of \\naffordable housing will be sought on-site in the first instance. Only in exceptional circumstances will the provision of affordable housing be allowed off-site or as a commuted sum payment in lieu of the provision on-site. These exceptional circumstances could include: \\n•\\n ‘land swaps’; \\n•\\n securing a higher level of provision on another \\nsite;\\n \\n•\\n better addressing priority needs, especially for af\\nfordable family housing; and \\n•\\n securing a more balanced community\\n.\\n6.38 In order to create balanced, mixed and sustainable communities, the provision of affordable housing on-site should be dispersed amongst the market housing. Therefore all affordable housing provision should be indistinguishable from market housing on the site. The type and size of affordable housing units provided should also reflect those that are built to be sold on the housing market and are Policy PP11\\nAffordable housing\\n(a) To meet housing needs, the Council will seek to maximise the amount of affordable housing from all housing schemes (Use Class C3) of 11 or more homes or over 1,000 sq. m in floor space.

Proposals for housing to meet the needs of the ageing population should demonstrate a clear understanding of the type of care it is intended to deliver, and reflect current and emerging best practice guidance such as that provided by Housing our Ageing Population Panel for Innovation\\n23 (HAPPI) and Dementia Friendly \\nCommunities24. Grouping care options together \\nprovides a degree of flexibility and movement between various levels of care. It is important that the range of accommodation options available to the ageing population form part of mixed sustainable communities and are located in accessible places within easy walking distance to transport links, shops and services.\\n6.45 Poole experiences a high level of under-\\noccupancy amongst older owner occupiers (around 7,000 households), with 57% of older person households occupied by a single/couple aged 65+ having at least two spare bedrooms. In addition, a significant proportion of older people own their homes without a mortgage. With the number of people aged 75+ continuing to grow, the potential demand for specialist housing for leasehold/sale could be high, particularly in the affluent areas of Broadstone and Canford able to be secured by Registered Providers.\\n6.39 The Council recognises that it is often difficult \\nto find Registered Providers\\n22 (RP’s), to take on \\na small number of units from individual schemes due to management issues and costs. Therefore on sites of 20 homes or less the Council, where an RP is unwilling to take on the required level of affordable housing, will accept a commuted sum payment in lieu of the provision of affordable housing on-site. The applicant would need to demonstrate that they contacted the Council’s preferred RP’s to see if they would take on a scheme with 5 affordable housing units or less for their site. The financial contribution will be equivalent to the provision of affordable housing on-site (build, land and servicing costs). An RP, such as a housing association, is a non-for-profit organisation which are registered with and regulated by the Homes and Communities Agency and for which target rents are determined through the national rent regime.   6.40 In instances where a developer contests that the scheme is not financially able to meet the affordable housing policy requirements, the onus would lie with the developer to demonstrate the maximum amount of affordable housing and tenure mix that could be achieved on the site viably, through the submission of a Residual Land Value (RLV) assessment. \\n6.41 All C3 Use Class proposals of 11 homes or \\nmore will be required to provide affordable housing (including retirement properties).

These factors suggest that there could be significant scope for some older people to move to more suitable, accessible and manageable accommodation, thereby freeing up much needed family housing.   6.46 There are four main ways in which the Poole Local Plan seeks to address the issue of what type of housing and facilities older people want and need to ensure communities are sustainable, inclusive and mixed: \\n•\\n through the retention of existing viable care \\nhomes;\\n \\n•\\n by seeking to bring forward new care homes;  \\n•\\n by supporting the provision of well-designed specialist housing accommodation across the whole range of housing types aimed at the growing ageing population (i.e. extra care; sheltered housing etc.); and \\n•\\n by increasing the stock of adaptable and accessible homes which can help elderly people to live active and independent lives for longer\\n. \\nForecasting demand and capacity\\n6.47 The Council has undertaken a more focussed \\nassessment of housing need for older people25, \\nwhich is based upon more recent population projections than those used in the SHMA and uses the most up-to-date recommended levels of provision by housing type and tenure from the Housing LIN toolkit\\n26. Current supply and unmet \\nneed is also considered. This study covers the period 2015-2033 and forms the basis for the Council’s strategy set out below. \\nSpecialist housing provision in Poole6.48 For many vulnerable older people, having \\nthe chance to avoid residential care and live in specially designed housing as tenants or owner-occupiers is an important element in retaining independence and dignity in older age. Allied to this, the suitability of housing is an important factor in helping older people to retain their independence, but it is acknowledged that the suitability of housing can alter markedly with changes in personal circumstances.\\n6.49 In addition to the more recognised forms of \\nspecialist accommodation such as sheltered and \\nType of specialist accommodation No. Homes to \\n2025No. of homes to \\n2033Total No. Homes to \\n2033\\nLeasehold sheltered housing 1,743 451 2,194\\nEnhanced sheltered housing For rent 180 38 218\\nFor sale 76 38 114\\nExtra care housing For rent 225 56 281\\nFor sale 505 113 618\\nTotal 2,729 696 3,425\\nFigure 24: Estimated net need for specialist housing accommodation (2015-2033). \\nSource:  Needs assessment of the future need for specialist housing and support services for older people in \\nPoole (October 2016).\\n25Needs assessment of the future need for specialist housing and support services for older people in Poole (2016).\\n26Updated Housing LIN Toolkit: ‘Housing in Later Life – Planning ahead for specialist housing for older people’.enhanced sheltered housing, models of housing \\naimed at those aged 55+ such as Extra Care housing have gained popularity as a realistic and viable alternative to ‘institutional’ care models.

This is a significant proportion of the overall housing target (25%) of 14,200 homes, and is reliant on the market bringing forward such sites.\\nAdaptable and accessible homes\\n 6.50 Following the housing standards review changes from 1st October 2015, local authorities can specify additional technical standards to be met through Building Regulations.

This estimate suggests that an additional 816 care home bed spaces will be required over the plan period (323 residential care and 493 nursing home bed spaces). This is in addition to the overall housing target of 14,200 homes. The allocated sites set out in this chapter contribute to around half of the target. The Council expects the remaining need to be met through current commitments and windfall.\\n6.53 A number of care homes lost in Poole have \\nbeen located in buildings which have become outmoded, less attractive to the client base, and less able to meet statutory accommodation standards. Together these factors have placed into question the economic viability of such homes. As a result such facilities have come under pressure for further conversion or demolition for the development of market flats and houses in an economic climate where land values have significantly increased. It is important, given the identified needs that this plan seeks to retain existing care beds stock where viable to do so.\\n6.54 Certain types of care home are allowed within to a wider range of occupants. Given Poole’s \\ncircumstances, with an ageing population that is over the national average and the high target for the number of specialist homes that are needed, the Council will require that major schemes include a mix of housing types designed to meet Building Regulations Part M4(2) for adaptable and accessible homes. This will contribute towards meeting the target of 3,425 specialist homes. Care homes 6.51 The majority of homes in Poole are privately run, although there are a small number operated by specialist voluntary organisations. There are no Council-run care homes in Poole.

Concentrations of HMOs can result in an imbalance in the demographic profile of the local community and can have an adverse effect on the character and amenity of affected neighbourhoods through such problems as increased noise, additional waste requirements, on-street parking and anti-social behaviour.  \\n6.61 The Bournemouth area of Winton, which lies \\nimmediately to the east of the university campuses, is popular with students due to its proximity to the universities and as a consequence has significant concentrations of student HMOs. To address this and other issues around HMOs, Bournemouth Borough Council implemented a borough-wide Article 4 Direction, supported by planning policy, the implementation of which seeks to avoid high concentrations of this form of development within a given area. 6.62 In 2013, the Council also implemented an Article 4 Direction, supported by a criteria based policy, to complement Bournemouth’s approach and to guard against any potential displacement of student HMO accommodation in nearby Winton to Talbot Village.

The economy is healthy, characterised by high levels of employment, above average Gross Value Added (GVA), a diverse and resilient economy with strengths in particular key sectors; and a high quality natural environment which makes it an attractive place to live and work. Poole’s economy is resilient as it does not rely on any one sector.

Poole’s economy remains \\nstrong and continues to grow\\nEnabling the economy to continue to grow benefits all of Poole’s residents through \\nthe provision of job opportunities and new shopping facilities. Poole is traditionally an engineering and manufacturing hub based around the Port, but diversification has ensured that the local economy is robust. Improving the affordability of housing for the work force is a challenge, and further diversification to boost higher wage sectors is an ambition. The success of Poole’s two universities in creative media across the world provides the opportunity for graduates to set up their own businesses in Poole and grow new sectors. The town centre is the focus for shopping and in the face of competition from on-line shopping it needs to become a shopping and leisure destination, providing a vibrant heart to the town serving the needs of Poole’s residents as well as new residents from the ambitious regeneration plans in the town centre. \\nwith the right skills to help local businesses. \\nBournemouth University has 17,000 students at two campuses, Talbot Village in Poole and the Lansdowne Quarter in Bournemouth and specialises in management, media and communication, science and technology and health and social sciences.

The universities have national and international recognition for links with creative/media industries. Bournemouth and Poole college works closely with local businesses to match up courses with employment needs.  7.3 Poole town centre remains the focus for shopping, but will have to embrace the challenges from changing consumer habits and online shopping. The major redevelopment proposed for the town centre provides the opportunity to reinvigorate the town centre as a shopping, cultural and commercial leisure destination, boosting the local economy and standard of living of the residents of Poole.  \\n7.4 Tourism makes a major contribution to the \\neconomy of Poole, with visitors contributing over £200m annually, supported by over 5,000 jobs in local businesses.

These employment areas cover about 293 hectares of land and, when opportunities arise, sites within them are subject to new investment and rejuvenation. Poole is regarded as the conurbation’s industrial hub, with the three largest employment areas, Nuffield, Mannings Heath and Fleets Lane being of strategic importance, not only to Poole but to the wider south-east Dorset area. These key industrial estates are supported by a network of supporting estates, the efficient use and reuse of which will be crucial to meeting future projected job growth, particularly in B use class employment such as research & development, light industrial, general industrial, storage and distribution uses. \\n7.9 Monitoring confirms that industrial and warehouse premises \\nwithin Poole’s industrial estates operate at relatively low vacancy rates, currently standing at approximately 3% when set against the overall total of such floor space across Poole.

Where an applicant seeks to demonstrate there is no reasonable prospect of an employment site coming forward, then the Council will expect the submission of appropriate evidence, such as analysis of employment land supply, future needs assessment and impact of its loss against the strategic objectives set out in the plan as well as full and proper marketing as described in Policy PP40: Viability, to consider the relative merits of such proposals.(iii) the site might not be viable for continued or new employment use due to particular physical or other constraints, such as prohibitively expensive site remediation works.\\n7.11 Where these circumstances apply, \\nredeveloping the site for other uses could offer an opportunity to help meet other development needs, such as care homes, particularly where they are located in sustainable transport corridors with access to local services.\\n7.12 When considering proposals on an isolated \\nemployment site, the Council will have regard to the suitability and viability of the site for continued or new employment uses in the first instance, and then as part of a mixed use scheme.

This has resulted in a number of large office buildings, primarily in Poole town centre, receiving Prior Approval consent for conversion to residential use. Over 20,000 sq. m of office floor space secured Prior Approval consent for conversion to residential accommodation, across a range of premises used as offices. This leaves 9,000 sq. m of vacant office accommodation remaining in Poole. 7.14 There is a need for approximately 39,000 sq. m of B1 office space over the plan period. A significant proportion of this is expected to be delivered at Talbot Village as part of the Talbot Village Trust’s strategy to deliver a new innovation quarter linked to the universities. To support sustainable patterns of development and the vitality of the town centre the remainder of additional floor space should be located within the town centre, which will be delivered through implementation of the town centre strategy in Chapter 5.

Following this the landowner gained Reserved Matters permission for the northern end of the site.  7.20 The site whilst permitted for employment uses, does present an opportunity to deliver, in part, much needed housing. Therefore in addition to utilising this site for employment uses, the Poole Local Plan supports the principle of housing on the northern end of the site, whilst allocating 5 hectares of employment land to the south. The delivery of employment on this site will be crucial to reducing the need to travel for new residents on sites North and West of Bearwood. \\n7.21 The landowner will need to ensure that the \\nemployment site is brought forward alongside the housing.

The development of the employment site will also provide a buffer between the proposed housing and Canford Heath, discouraging access and thereby contributing to the mitigation of potential harmful effects on the European and internationally protected site. \\nPolicy PP18\\nMagna Business Park\\nMagna Business Park is allocated for approximately 16,000 sq. m of new employment floor space provided that: \\n(a) employment uses proposed are compatible with adjacent housing;\\n \\n(b) suitable access arrangements can be achieved to ensure that the employment use is compatible in terms of amenity of  residents of the housing development to the north;\\n \\n(c) the site is designed in such a way to ensure that residents of the housing development and users of the employment site are prevented from direct access onto Canford Heath;\\n \\n(d) suitable mitigation is provided including replacement foraging habitat and undeveloped wildlife corridors to ensure  protection of bird species such as nightjar;  \\n(e) the site provides suitable transition between the urban edge of Poole and the \\ncountryside, with strong landscaping to provide a permanent Green Belt boundary; and  \\n \\n(f) Make a contribution towards the implementation of a sustainable transport corridor, including bus services, between the site and Poole/Bournemouth town centres.', doc_id='dc28ab0f-ce46-471f-b90f-266de76f9182', embedding=None, doc_hash='4cf2a1d9bd49b92d118ab8c2de9d1c282600b409e9188d4dea9b98022fa3a11e', extra_info={'page_label': 'b69', 'file_name': 'poole_local_plan.pdf'}), Document(text='Poole Local Plan70Poole Port  \\n7.22 Poole Port is a vital economic asset to Poole \\nand the wider sub-region. As well as the significant number of employees based at the port, it also indirectly supports many thousands of jobs within Poole, Dorset and the South West, as well as providing an essential link to industrial markets across the UK, such as the manufacturing sector in the West Midlands. Its deep water frontages offer conventional cargo handling on the north-facing wharves, and containerised (roll-on, roll-off) cargo handling and cross-channel ferry services from its southern quays. With a dedicated rail link, there is potential to increase rail freight handling. Sunseeker, one of Poole’s major employer’s, also operates part of its motor yacht manufacturing business at the port.\\n7.23 The port’s sub-regional economic importance \\nis recognised by the DLEP, which has identified the area as a key location for economic growth. Significant recent investment by the DLEP, Council and Government in bridge and highways infrastructure improvements has enhanced the port’s accessibility. A Port Link Road is also proposed as part of the redevelopment of the former Pilkington Tiles and Power Station sites. Development proposals should consider the scale and nature of impacts on the Strategic Road Network.\\n7.24 Poole Harbour Commissioners as owner of \\nthe port have produced a masterplan that sets out proposals for the port’s development over the next 25-30 years with the aim of becoming a regionally significant feeder port. A crucial part of this strategy is already underway to create a new south-facing deep water quay enabling larger cruise ships to visit the port enhancing local tourism. To remain a competitive and commercially viable operation, the masterplan also identifies the importance of diversifying into other commercial sectors such as marine-related industry and leisure uses (e.g. berths for leisure craft, marine visitor facilities and events).  7.25 Although the port is in a relatively less sensitive part of Poole Harbour in ecological terms, it is nevertheless vital that development proposals do not have an adverse impact upon European and internationally protected sites. To adapt to rising sea levels from climate change, new development in the port will also need to incorporate necessary measures to address flood risk.\\n7.26 Port-related activities for the purposes of shipping include boat repairs, dredging, \\naggregates-handling, manufacture of building materials following the import of aggregates, storage of cargo, manufacture of products reliant upon imports from the Harbour, boat storage for larger vessels, and rail freight uses associated with the port rail link. There will also be scope to provide for the flexible use of quays and loading facilities to serve other port-related uses such as boat building, on condition that such activities require access to deep water frontage. Other parts of the port could serve to support general port activities. For example, the provision of parking facilities that support the role and function of the port operation.\\nPoole Port', doc_id='231c98de-c627-48ad-bf48-9ead45f6beb7', embedding=None, doc_hash='adcf1169501e8e8674738d65c811e413e5357cc4f9da9b22fac84ce8c3cdda2b', extra_info={'page_label': 'b70', 'file_name': 'poole_local_plan.pdf'}), Document(text='Poole Local Plan71\\nPolicy PP19\\nPoole Port\\nThe Council will support the growth of Poole Port as a regionally significant feeder port with \\ncapacity to accommodate larger cruise ships, as well as its continued sea-based handling of freight and passengers and its diversification into marine-related industrial and leisure activities, in accordance with the following criteria:\\n(a) proposals will be permitted where they are for port-related activities, marine-related industrial uses, other employment uses or marine leisure uses that would be compatible with the function of the port;\\n(b) sites with deep water frontage will be reserved for uses which require access to \\nsuch frontage; and\\n(c) development will not be permitted where it would prejudice the use of the rail link \\nfor freight handling.Improving Local Skills\\n7.27 The Council will continue to work with the DLEP Employment and Skills Board, local schools, colleges, universities, further education providers and businesses to ensure that graduates possess the right skills to enable economic growth. For example there is a national shortage of skilled construction workers at a time when the country is increasing house building and this needs addressing in Poole to ensure that the Poole Local Plan is successful in delivering a step change and meeting needs. There is also the ambition to encourage skilled university graduates and entrepreneurs to set up businesses in South East Dorset, in particular the creative industries related to IT and media. The Council is committed to supporting young people achieve their ambition and works closely with partners and schools to invest in improved facilities and to ensure there are suitable school places for a growing population. Work has recently been completed on the Ocean Academy and there are plans for investment in Hillbourne School (site U16). \\nSite A1: South of Creekmoor\\n7.28 The Council has been investigating possible \\nsites for a new secondary school for Poole to meet future needs, but has been unable to secure a suitable site within the urban area. Some of the land at Creekmoor has been allocated for a school use in previous local plans and SANGs as part of the expansion of Upton Country Park. Following the findings of the Green Belt Review, and in conjunction with the need to plan for future schools provision, the Council considers there ', doc_id='c6430d70-8d28-4f44-bede-95c24a508410', embedding=None, doc_hash='910f41dfb4ef18b6e925de4613d56e3260792c3fb97b95483fe65d5f582a701b', extra_info={'page_label': 'b71', 'file_name': 'poole_local_plan.pdf'}), Document(text='Poole Local Plan72are exceptional circumstances to amend the \\nGreen Belt boundary to remove land south of Creekmoor as shown in Figure 14. It is anticipated that school provision on this site is unlikely to be required until the latter end of the plan period or beyond. Feasibility work indicates that a larger site is required than that previously allocated which further supports the release of this land from the Green Belt. The future use of land south of Creekmoor will be kept under review throughout the plan period to ensure that education and other needs are met as required. \\n7.29 The provision of a foot and cycle bridge to \\nUpton Country Park across the dual carriageway, will improve accessibility and encourage  circular \\nwalking and cycling routes that promote active and healthy lifestyles whilst protecting nearby heathland.\\nSite A2: Canford School\\n7.30 The Council recognises that Canford School \\nplays an important role within the local economy as both an education facility and employer. The school campus and grounds occupy the former heart of the ancient Manor of Canford and as such have an historical significance to the origins and growth of the county and Borough of Poole. There are a number of listed buildings within or close to the school boundary, including the Grade I Listed parish Church of St John, John of Gaunt’s Kitchen and the main school building itself, which is the former Manor House. In addition, the whole of the site falls within the Canford Magna Conservation Area and the grounds are included on the Dorset Gardens Trust Local List. Given the economic, architectural and historic importance of the school and the need to maintain it in a viable and optimal use; the Council supports the school in bringing forward essential development to meet its operational and educational needs over the plan period. The alteration to the Green Belt boundary (as outlined in chapter 4) will exclude the majority of the built up parts of the school campus from the designation, which will also allow Canford School to secure its long term future on the site.Site A3: Talbot Village \\n7.31 Bournemouth University and Arts University \\nBournemouth, located in the Talbot Village area of the borough, perform a vital role to the economy of Poole and wider south east Dorset area.   7.32 The universities wish to invest in further academic buildings and facilities in order to maintain their national university status. The growth of the universities and their future economic success will be dependent on the carefully planned development of land at and around their Talbot campuses.\\n7.33 In recognition of this, the Council has adopted \\nthe Talbot Village SPD to set out further guidance for how it is envisaged land around the universities will be developed into the future, to maintain their important role within the conurbation.  The SPD establishes how proposals for development are to be implemented to deliver the vision for an academic and employment centre of excellence, together with the enhancement of associated open farmland nearby, to provide publicly accessible open space that will help to offset recreational use of the wildlife haven of Talbot Heath.\\n7.34 Whilst supporting the universities is important \\nfrom an economic and social perspective, the area is close to Talbot Heath, an European and internationally important site. Any growth at the universities will therefore need to be carefully managed from an environmental perspective to ensure there are no adverse impacts on sensitive habitats. Talbot Village is also close to residential areas that requires any development to be \\n© Crown copyright and database rights 2018.\\nOrdnance Survey 1000124248.\\nFigure 29: Canford School Green Belt boundary', doc_id='67ffafb7-1dcd-4be2-bd2f-f0bf62df71cc', embedding=None, doc_hash='162ee8cd62da668ed747bb025a8fe6d0f47ad61f3c3e8c39e2ef43a71f302011', extra_info={'page_label': 'b72', 'file_name': 'poole_local_plan.pdf'}), Document(text='Poole Local Plan73sensitively designed in terms of siting and scale \\nto ensure that existing neighbouring residential amenity is preserved. \\n7.35 Bringing these requirements together, it \\nis important that the Poole Local Plan makes appropriate policy provision to support and carefully manage the sustainable growth of the universities over the plan period. To do this, the Poole Local Plan allocates land at Talbot Village in PP21 to deliver the vision of the Talbot Village SPD, as well as establishing guiding principles to avoid and/or mitigate adverse environmental impacts.  \\n7.36 The proposals at the universities will \\npredominantly take place across three broad character areas; the Talbot Academic Quarter, the Talbot Innovation Quarter and Talbot Heath. The overarching expectations for each character area are explained further as follows:\\nTalbot Academic Quarter (TV1)7.37 The Talbot Academic Quarter, broadly \\ncomprising the existing University campuses and adjacent land, will be the focus for new academic floor space and student bed spaces. This area includes land outside of the 400m heathland buffer around Talbot Heath that may be suitable for housing (Use Class C3).

This area has the \\npotential to provide grow on space for the universities, space for business start-ups or for new industries to develop and flourish. \\n7.39 Development within the Highmoor Farm area should reflect the specialist courses \\nprovided by the universities, to support innovation and provide employment and research opportunities to retain highly skilled graduates within the local economy. The final mix of uses should therefore include B1 with a particular focus on ICT ; creative/\\ndigital industries; environmental technologies; bio-medical and health care facilities (a private hospital or a care home for instance). Other ancillary uses demonstrated as necessary to support the social and business environment functions of the innovation quarter could also be appropriate (e.g. conference/meeting/academic space, café/coffee shop etc). It is expected that such ancillary uses would not be available outside the normal operational hours of surrounding businesses in the innovation quarter. In all cases, development in the Highmoor Farm area will need to be compatible with being within the 400m heathland buffer to Talbot Heath, as well as appropriate in relation to adjacent residential areas. \\nTalbot Heath (TV3)7.40 To ensure that the proposed growth does not cause harm to Talbot Heath, the \\nvision requires the provision of a heathland support area to deflect recreation pressures from the heath. Even with the delivery of the heathland support area, individual proposals across the allocation may need further Habitats Regulations Assessment to confirm their acceptability before planning permission can be granted.\\n7.41 Areas TV1, TV2 and TV3 are illustrated in figure 30.\\n \\nOther considerations\\n7.42 In addition to land use, it is important for development to also deliver enhanced \\ntransport connections to the allocation area. Improved public transport with a new access road and bus hub, and improved cycling/pedestrian provision with new paths is critical to making the universities accessible by sustainable forms of transport. Recent planning applications have secured some of the transport enhancements. With more applications expected over the plan period it will be important that all new developments, where practicable, contributes to improving sustainable access and movement to the area.7.43 \\nThe Council also recognise that development must be \\ndesigned and located sensitively to adjacent residential areas such as Dulsie Road and Purchase Road to address issues such as visual impact and amenity. This will in particular require a high standard of design, incorporation of landscaping and suitable siting and scale of buildings set back from residential properties in Talbot Village to the west and Talbot Woods to the east. \\n7.44 Any proposed further expansion in addition to the \\nrequirements set out in PP21: Talbot Village within the Local Plan period, including at the universities, will need to be agreed with the Council, comply with other relevant Local Plan policies and provide a detailed assessment of impact and mitigation measures where necessary.\\nTV3TV1\\nTV2\\n© Crown copyright and database rights 2018.\\nOrdnance Survey 1000124248.\\nFigure 30: Proposals for Talbot Village', doc_id='e1d30ef8-45b0-4d99-862d-66e6577f0cc8', embedding=None, doc_hash='17d4a1ef3305fdcbb7b562dd8ec11e20013433aa6f8106d419f4bb4de8fda426', extra_info={'page_label': 'b74', 'file_name': 'poole_local_plan.pdf'}), Document(text='Poole Local Plan75\\nPolicy PP21\\nTalbot Village\\nSite A3 Land at Talbot Village as shown on the Policies Map provides the \\nopportunity to deliver major growth of the universities, in accordance with the following requirements: \\n1) General principles All development proposals at Talbot Village must:a) contribute towards mitigation measures to ensure no adverse impact \\nupon the European and internationally important site of Talbot Heath;    b) be compatible with surrounding uses within the Talbot Village allocation and not prejudice the delivery of the requirements set out in  2 (a) and (b); and c) be designed to ensure that the residential amenity of nearby residential properties is respected.\\n2) Proposed developmentGrowth at Talbot Village will be carefully developed to deliver:  (a) expansion of Bournemouth University and the Arts University (TV1) \\nto create around 33,000 sq. m of additional academic floor space and 450 student bed spaces, located primarily on, or adjacent to, the existing university campuses; (b) an innovation quarter (TV2), on land at and around Highmoor Farm, comprising up to 25,000 sq. m gross floor space to help support the role and function of the universities and comprising a mix of B1 uses, health care facilities and other university-related uses; (c) ancillary uses, where they are demonstrably needed to support the primary function of the innovation quarter; (d) new housing (Use Class C3) in the area beyond the 400 metre heathland buffer from Talbot Heath, at a density to reflect adjacent residential areas; and (e) a heathland support area (TV3) of around 12 hectares.

Each of these areas is different in scale and function but play an important role in ensuring that everyone, including those less able to travel, are within 800 metres (10 minutes walking distance) of convenience shops. \\n7.47 In addition, Poole’s 3 retail parks provide suitable locations for \\nbulky goods/DIY stores. For Poole’s retail parks, at least 70% of retail floor space for bulky goods should be goods of a large physical nature (for example DIY, furniture, carpets) that sometimes require large areas for storage or display. Despite restrictive policies and conditions on planning consents over the years, it could be considered that the type of goods sold in these retail parks has become more blurred with typical town centre stores appearing. These changes plus the availability of free parking and relatively cheap rental prices, is providing competition for Poole town centre. The Council’s retail evidence shows that there is no growth envisaged for Poole’s retail parks. In line with national policy, the Council seeks to meet identified needs by promoting a town centre first approach to retail and other town centre uses. Therefore, proposals for new retail floor space in retail parks or for change of permitted use will need to satisfy the sequential test and, if over 280 sq. m (net floor space), the impact assessment.\\n \\nKEY\\nTown Centre\\nDistrict Centre\\nLocal Centre © Crown Copyright and database right 2018.\\nOrdnance Survey 1000124248.\\nRetail ParkNeighbourhood Parade\\nMain roads\\n27Poole town centre, district centres and local centres are categorised as ‘town centres’ in retail policy, but for simplicity only Poole town centre will adopt such a name.\\n28Poole and Purbeck Town Centres, Retail and Leisure Study (2014)Figure 31: Location of Poole’s retail facilities', doc_id='fcfd6076-489d-4276-89f0-f947a3a223a0', embedding=None, doc_hash='a3883bd129ec2dcfef4c5a012b9400a23a3c2d106d2fcc86e43eed871c49bcb3', extra_info={'page_label': 'b76', 'file_name': 'poole_local_plan.pdf'}), Document(text='Poole Local Plan77Shopping frontages\\n7.48 The clustering of similar businesses such as \\nshops, services and facilities, cafés, restaurants, leisure and entertainment and other civic uses in primary and secondary shopping frontages makes town centres more attractive and sociable. In turn, this increases the footfall which helps support businesses and creates an identity and a sense of place for the community. This enhances vitality and vibrancy making the area more attractive to residents, visitors and employees.  \\n7.49 Due to the increase in on-line shopping and \\nhome shopping, town centres may no longer need to be retail-focused but instead provide a social and leisure environment where people meet and visit. In response to these trends, the Council is making shopping frontages more flexible and adaptable to changes in the economy and shopping habits. This includes introducing more active uses such as cafés/restaurants, civic and social uses. \\n7.50 The Poole Local Plan designates primary \\nand secondary shopping frontages in Poole town centre and the 3 district centres. To protect these frontages the Council considers an over-concentration of uses in shopping frontage as a whole, rather than an individual parade, as approximately:\\n(i) More than 50% of units not within the A1 Use \\nClass (retail) in a primary shopping frontage; and \\n(ii) More than 50% of units not within the A Use \\nClass in a secondary shopping frontage7.51 There are some shopping frontages in the designated primary shopping area that are not designated as a primary or secondary shopping frontage.

When considering out-of-centre locations as part of the sequential approach, preference is given to Poole’s existing retail parks over other out-of-centre locations (designated leisure parks/employment areas). The Council will also require any retail or leisure proposals over 280 sq. m (net) outside of designated boundaries/allocations to be accompanied by a retail impact assessment. The Council is setting this local threshold as it reflects the typical scale of retail development in Poole and is based on the definition of a ‘large shop’ in the Sunday Trading Act. Submitted impact assessments will be assessed against the Council’s strategic study\\n30 published at the time the planning application is submitted.\\n7.54 For retail purposes, edge-of-centre is defined \\nas being 300 metres from the primary shopping area boundary. For all other main town centres uses, edge-of-centre is defined as being within 300 metres from the Poole town centre boundary or other centre boundaries. For office development this is 500 metres from the Poole town centre boundary, district centres and local centre boundaries and a transport interchange station. Proposals for sites not in the Primary Shopping Area/town centre boundary or located edge-of-centre are out-of-centre.  \\n7.55 Upon the grant of planning permission \\nfor retail and main town centre uses outside of designated frontages and boundaries, the Council may impose conditions to ensure that development does not have an adverse impact on the vitality and viability of Poole town centre, district centres and local centres.

Poole Harbour has stunning natural scenery and provides a superb arena for water-based activities. Poole’s beaches are held in high regard due to their quality and cleanliness. The town centre is a key focus for tourism due to its strong heritage offer, characterised by the historic Quay and Old Town, and shopping facilities centred around the Dolphin Shopping Centre and High Street.  \\n7.58 Poole Tourism Partnership is a collaboration \\nbetween the Council and many of the town’s tourism businesses, with the aim of making Poole a high quality, vibrant and prosperous year-round resort. The Partnership’s strategic priorities to 2025 include protecting and enhancing Poole’s natural and built environment, developing economic resilience by increasing year-round demand, protecting existing tourism assets and supporting investment in new attractions and accommodation, and nurturing the town’s distinctive tourism offer.\\nTourist Zones and Attractions7.59 Poole’s two main tourist zones, as shown on \\nthe Policies Map, are: \\n(i) the area of the town centre comprising The \\nQuay/Old Town/High Street/Dolphin Centre/Poole Park; and \\n(ii) Poole’s beaches and chines stretching from \\nSandbanks to Branksome Dene. \\n7.60 The Sustaining Poole’s Seafront SPD sets \\nout the Council’s proposals for conserving, improving and investing in the town’s beaches and should be considered as relevant proposals are being developed. \\n7.61 Poole’s main tourist attractions, as shown on \\nthe Policies Map, are: Poole Quay, Upton Country Park, a country park surrounding a historic manor house; Rockley Park, a self-catering holiday centre on the edge of Poole Harbour; Tower Park, a family-oriented leisure and entertainments centre providing a range of year-round activities; and Poole Park and Compton Acres, large historic parks with distinctive gardens.  7.62 Poole’s main tourist zones and attractions provide a diverse range of day, evening and night time activities it will be important to ensure that new development in these locations supports their importance as attractive destinations for visitors and residents alike. This will include retaining key tourism uses and attractions where they continue to be viable.\\nTourist accommodation 7.63 Poole has a diversity of tourist \\naccommodation. In recent years there has been some loss of outdated premises to other uses, although this has been partly offset by investment in new hotels in the town centre. To ensure the ongoing strength of Poole’s tourism offer, it is important to maintain an adequate supply of tourist accommodation, and support improvements to the existing stock. The Council will particularly seek to resist proposals leading to a loss of touring and static caravan parks, or hotel and other tourist accommodation containing 10 or more bedrooms. Exceptions to this approach would be where financial non-viability can be demonstrated or the proposal is necessary to secure investment in improving the remaining accommodation on site, or elsewhere in the town.\\nThe evening/night time economy  \\n7.64 An exciting, safe and attractive evening/night \\ntime economy can make an important contribution to Poole’s tourism offer.

The economic vitality and viability of Poole’s town and local centres can also be bolstered by a healthy evening/night time economy which complements day time activity with an appropriate mix of ‘after dark’ uses.\\n7.65 Poole’s main evening/night time economy \\ncentres are Ashley Cross, Ashley Road, Canford Cliffs, Penn Hill, Poole town centre (particularly the Quay) and Tower Park. Broadstone and Lilliput have also seen recent development in their night time economies.\\n7.66 In order to sustain Poole’s evening/night \\ntime economy, it will be important to ensure that businesses do not have unreasonable restrictions placed on them due to changes in nearby land uses since they were established. For example, where noise-sensitive development such as housing is proposed in, or in close proximity to, established evening/night time economy centres, the proposal should be accompanied by an assessment of environmental noise and, where necessary, an appropriate scheme of mitigation measures to ensure adequate levels of amenity for future occupiers of the development. \\n7.67 The careful management of evening/night \\ntime uses is also important. This will ensure a safe and welcoming environment is maintained for all ages and social groups, a variety of uses and activities can be enjoyed and harmful amenity impacts avoided. \\n7.68 High concentrations of food and drink uses \\ncan impact upon the health of the local population and can also have an adverse effect on the amenity of a locality through noise and general disturbance, fumes, smells, litter and late night activity, including those impacts arising from the use of external areas. An over-concentration of food and drink uses can also reduce the offer of other essential shops and services, reducing the success and diversity of shopping areas.  An over-concentration is considered to be more than 70% of units for food and drink uses. ‘Food and drink’ uses are defined as those including Use Classes A3 (restaurants and cafés), A4 (drinking establishments), A5 (hot food takeaways), nightclubs, social clubs, and other premises in which the consumption of alcohol and/or hot food is a significant activity. 7.69 Applicants should have regard to the Council’s Licensing Policy in preparing development proposals where an alcohol license will be required. The Council is preparing a strategy for delivering an exciting and safe night time environment in Poole. This will profile the town’s main night time centres, providing information as to the licensing aims and issues specific to each location. When finalised it will provide useful guidance that new development proposals should also have regard to.\\n7.70 In line with the NPPF, some tourism and \\nevening economy uses are ‘main town centre uses’, and these proposals would need to be in accordance with PP22: Retail and main town centre uses (sequential test and impact assessment) and Figure 32: Retail Hierarchy.

Poole benefits from approximately 1,100 hectares of public open space and this includes all unrestricted publicly accessible parks, amenity areas, play areas, woodland, the beaches and heathland. Open spaces are shown on the Policies Map, although some sites are not mapped due to their small size, but are still protected in accordance with this policy. The Council will support local communities in designating these smaller open spaces through neighbourhood plans. The Council has designated a number of new open spaces in the Poole Local Plan. These are listed in Appendix 2: Changes to the Policies Map. \\n8.8 The Council will seek to ensure that local residents have \\naccess to open space to meet their needs. The Poole Open Space Needs Assessment sets out in detail the existing provision and where shortfalls exist. While the overall provision of open space is sufficient it does vary across Poole. To ensure sufficient open space is provided for future residents, existing open spaces will be retained unless specific circumstances exist. For example, development which is ancillary to the main use of the space such as changing rooms, play provision or a café will be appropriate providing it enhances the overall function and attractiveness of the open space. \\n8.9 In some instances developer contributions will be used \\nto improve existing open spaces and their accessibility. Providing open space on the town centre regeneration sites is challenging and where on-site provision is less than the required standards, developer contributions will be used to secure improvements to accessible nearby public open space, such as Hamworthy Recreation Ground and Poole Park. The strategic urban extensions are required to incorporate open space (including SANGs) within their proposals to create a quality environment, whilst providing benefits to health and well-being and diverting recreational pressure away from the Dorset Heathlands.\\n8.10 Allotments are valuable community spaces that provide people with the opportunity \\nto enjoy regular physical exercise, meet new people and benefit from a healthier diet. There are many legal safeguards in place to protect allotments. The existing allotments will therefore be retained unless replacement allotment space is provided or it can be demonstrated that the existing space is surplus to requirements. In assessing if allotment space is surplus to requirements consideration will be given to the number of existing plot holders, the number of people on the waiting list for that site and if the availability of plots has been actively promoted and publicised. \\nPoole Park\\n', doc_id='a1f60e53-67a2-4daa-a604-02a84ac60515', embedding=None, doc_hash='1eeca2b980281813a076c188607609925857ad626a6fa0d4c4cd549151d85cb8', extra_info={'page_label': 'b86', 'file_name': 'poole_local_plan.pdf'}), Document(text='Poole Local Plan87\\nPolicy PP25\\nOpen space and allotments \\n(1) New open space and allotments  \\nNew development should contribute to the provision of a high quality network of open space ensuring links to and \\nbetween open spaces are provided where appropriate.  \\nStrategic sites should provide open space on-site giving consideration to the standards set out in the Open Space Needs \\nAssessment.

This list is not exhaustive and other sports and recreation facilities and their car parks may also be assessed against this policy.8.14 The priorities for retaining, maintaining and improving existing provision along with identification of any deficiencies are set out in the Council’s Built Facilities Assessment and Playing Pitch Assessment. These assessments will be kept under review and provide evidence regarding the nature of facilities in Poole. Specific reference to these documents should be made to support any proposals that result in the loss or reduction in capacity of sports and recreation facilities.  \\nCommunity facilities \\n8.15 Community facilities make an important contribution to people’s quality of life and general well-being. They provide for the health, social, educational, spiritual, recreational, leisure and cultural needs of the community. In addition, such facilities help to create vibrant, sustainable neighbourhoods. The Council supports proposals which provide and improve community facilities and services, whilst also protecting existing facilities unless certain criteria can be met. Community facilities include those within use class D1 of the use class order (clinics, health centres, crèches, day nurseries, day centres, schools, art galleries, museums, libraries, halls, places of worship, church halls, law courts, non educational/training centre). This list is not exhaustive and other community facilities and their car parks may also be assessed against this policy.  8.16 Proposals that would result in the loss of such facilities must show evidence that the loss would not result in a substantial decline in the range of facilities and services for local people; or that the facility is no longer needed and it is not feasible to support its continued existence. Evidence could include the results of marketing exercises to show that the facility cannot continue. Proposals seeking to replace community premises should also provide community benefit to outweigh the loss of the existing facility service. This could include replacement with a different type of community space or the provision of affordable housing. The community benefit sought will be proportionate to that which is lost and the extent to which the loss of the facility contributes to the decline of facilities and services to local people.

Design  \\n9.1 Poole has a rich and varied built environment, within a unique natural setting. Development in Poole has been largely influenced by its coastal location, the Stour river valley, the railway and protected areas of heathland. Poole contains a wide variety of development, encompassing traditional historic building styles from the mediaeval period through to 20th century suburban housing estates, tower blocks from the 1960s and 21st century contemporary architecture. North Poole has farm hamlets and ancient tracks of Saxon origin which served Canford Manor and Merley House and provided resources for the town in the early days of settlement. Historic parks and gardens and green spaces throughout the town provide important spaces for leisure and communal events. \\n9. Enhancing the outstanding natural \\nsetting and built environment of Poole\\nPoole’s natural environment is exceptional, with Poole Harbour and Dorset Heathlands afforded national \\nand international protection for nature conservation, as well as locally important sites and Green Belt. Given this setting, Poole’s growth will need to be carefully managed. Well-designed places are attractive, distinctive, safe, accessible and pleasant for a wide variety of users. They help to attract investment and visitors, facilitate growth and improve the quality of life for local people. Given the forecast economic growth and the need for new homes the existing trend of urban intensification is set to continue. Therefore this chapter sets out policies to ensure growth can be successfully accommodated in a way that responds to local character and preserves or enhances the setting of the historic built environment within Poole and its heritage assets. \\nFigure 34: Canford Cliffs: large plots, extensive tree cover, unique building designs, buildings lower \\nthan trees, low boundary walls and frontages planted with trees/hedging.

The policies set out in this chapter aim to ensure that new development can be successfully accommodated by preserving the valued features of Poole that give specific areas a distinctive character and sense of place. New development will be expected to be based on a design led approach that respects the prevailing characteristics of the local area and, where possible, enhances areas in need of improvement. The Council will produce guidance within a Design SPD to provide a more detailed analysis of the local character within different parts of Poole. This SPD will help to identify how new development can respond specifically to local distinctiveness and achieve good design. \\n9.4 For the purpose of this Plan, good design is \\ndefined as development that functions well, fits in with and enhances an area’s character within its context. Innovation is encouraged but it must not be at the expense of Poole’s existing character. Development will be expected to demonstrate how the scale, form, massing, appearance and use of materials come together to create a cohesive development for the site but also one that integrates positively with its surroundings, both now and in the future. As such, materials should be durable and capable of withstanding the maritime climate. \\n9.5 It will be important to ensure that the right \\nbalance is struck between delivering urban intensification, whilst maintaining high standards Figure 35: Old Town: varied roof profiles with many gabled roof forms, long narrow plots, limited landscaping, formal frontages, historic lamp posts and many Georgian buildings.\\nFigure 36: Oakdale: consistent building line, regular building widths, uniform heights and appearance, \\nlow rise.\\nFigure 37: Canford Magna: semi rural model village, informal layout, abundant landscaping, rich \\ndetailing with Lady Wimborne cottages, terraces, village hall, parish church and Grade 1 Listed former manor house (now Canford School).', doc_id='f2552f91-77ac-4566-b2e1-61d5f768db7b', embedding=None, doc_hash='fee8a4df01a549568d4051802c6540b326bcd497ae19f4f6f058cf52c6765abb', extra_info={'page_label': 'b91', 'file_name': 'poole_local_plan.pdf'}), Document(text='Poole Local Plan92\\nof amenity for existing and future occupants. For \\nhousing development, the Council encourages applicants to comply with the national prescribed space standards when preparing and submitting planning applications. Schemes that are significantly below these standards e.g. more than 20% of floor space will need to demonstrate how the development will achieve an acceptable standard of living for future occupants. \\n9.6 Where a planning application is required to be \\naccompanied by a Design and Access Statement, applicants are expected to explain how they have taken a design led approach in accordance with the principles set out in this chapter and other relevant design guidance. Where appropriate, a scheme should be supported by visualisations of the development form from viewpoints agreed with the Council, and additionally the Council may require some major developments to undertake independent design review as part of the process of preparing a planning application.   9.7 As part of the preparation of major schemes, developers should engage at an early stage with the Council and the local community. This should be carried out in accordance with the Council’s Statement of Community Involvement. A summary of any engagement carried out should be included as part of the Design and Access Statement (where required).

However, opportunities also exist for windfall development within the sustainable transport corridors and elsewhere in Poole, which will help meet Poole’s housing needs. Past development trends demonstrate that the large majority of windfall development either involves the demolition of an existing building or the subdivision of an existing plot to provide additional residential accommodation. On some sites this form of development can be successfully accommodated without detriment to the character of the area or to the amenity of surrounding residents. These sites tend to be the larger, more spacious plots where buildings are set back from the road. However, in other areas where the existing pattern of development is more compact, such intensification could erode Poole’s character. Therefore, the policy below aims to ensure that higher density forms of development are carefully managed across Poole through sensitive design. The Council will produce design guidance to clarify when such proposals will be considered acceptable.  9.10 In many areas dealing with the waste generated by more intensive forms of residential development pose a number of design and operational challenges.

Innovative solutions for \\naccommodating bin storage, such as underground bins, should therefore be considered and additional guidance regarding waste storage will be prepared.\\n9.11 It is acknowledged that in accommodating \\nmore flatted development some family housing will be replaced. However, increasing the supply of flatted development may also free up family housing within Poole where these homes are under occupied.\\nTall buildings  \\n9.12 In Poole tall buildings are considered to be those over six storeys (approximately 16 metres) or those which are substantially taller than their neighbours, for example in an area of single storey bungalows, a four or five storey building can be considered a tall building.\\n9.13 Proposals for tall buildings are an increasing \\nfeature in development proposals in Poole. Well-designed tall buildings in the right place could have a positive effect on the image of Poole and help to create an attractive townscape. They can also allow greater densities to be achieved, helping to address housing needs and contributing to the vitality of a place. However, by virtue of their size and visibility, such buildings if not designed carefully also have the potential to adversely affect the character of Poole, impinge on key views and dominate heritage assets. Tall buildings can also cause extensive overshadowing and result in an unpleasant street level environment due to micro-climatic changes and wind tunnelling effects. 9.14 The majority of Poole’s tall buildings are currently located in the town centre, particularly in Town Centre North. Given the established character of the area, additional tall buildings could be supported in Town Centre North and Twin Sails regeneration areas. It is recognised that encouraging tall buildings in these locations is an important component of boosting housing delivery and meeting needs. Whilst there are strategic advantages of this approach, any tall buildings on these sites will need to consider the relationship to adjacent low scale residential properties and heritage assets (including conservation areas), and ensure they are well integrated into the overall layout of the site. On these sites wider views will also need to be considered particularly that from Holes Bay where the Purbeck ridge forms a strong backdrop and landscape setting to the town. \\n9.15 Outside of the town centre there may \\nbe other locations that can accommodate tall buildings. For the Council to support such proposals they need to be positioned in suitable locations such as gateway sites or sites which highlight important facilities, activities or spaces and deliver wider community benefits. These could include affordable housing, health or education facilities, places of worship, community facilities or commercial uses that add to the social, economic or tourism offer of the town.  The relationship with surrounding properties will be of principle importance to ensure a suitable relationship exists that preserves the amenities of existing residents. \\n9.16 Any proposals involving tall buildings will \\nrequire early discussions with the Council and it is likely that modelling and testing will be necessary where there is potential for the tall building to result in wind tunnelling, up drafts, down drafts or eddying. Furthermore, in order to remove any adverse impacts on European and internationally important sites, buildings should be carefully designed to avoid key risks, such as bird flight lines, lighting and the appearance of solid vertical planes of mirrored glass.   9.17 As most tall buildings are likely to be classified as major development, the Council may require some schemes to be assessed through independent design review. \\n9.18 Proposals should also take account of the \\nPoole Quays Forum Neighbourhood Plan which includes additional policies on design within Poole town centre. \\nTall building at Hunger Hill in Poole\\n', doc_id='cad17939-11cc-40d4-ae08-55c5c8dca6e8', embedding=None, doc_hash='5ffd0c46bf8e4036c77026d9593f0c65e3dcf906337d0a73812f98e519cfd422', extra_info={'page_label': 'b95', 'file_name': 'poole_local_plan.pdf'}), Document(text='Poole Local Plan96\\nPolicy PP29\\nTall buildings\\nTown Centre North and the Twin Sails regeneration areas are considered to be the most \\nsuitable locations for tall buildings as part of the strategy to direct the highest densities to the town centre.

An attractive and well maintained historic environment is somewhere that people want to visit, explore and spend time in. A quality historic environment attracts investment, tourism and fosters a heritage-related construction sector to maintain it. Poole’s historic buildings, bridges, archaeological sites, historic parks and other features all make a significant contribution to sense of place, cultural life and identity.  \\n9.20 Heritage assets are protected by specific \\nplanning legislation\\n32 and national policy \\nrecognises the conservation of heritage assets as a core planning principle underlining decision taking. The Heritage Assets SPD identifies and provides information on the broad range and levels of significance of Poole’s built heritage, including:  \\n•\\n 231 listed buildings and structures;\\n•\\n 274 locally listed or non-designated heritage assets;\\n•\\n 4 Registered historic parks and gardens;\\n•\\n 16 conservation areas;\\n•\\n 180 known archaeological sites and scheduled ancient monuments; and \\n•\\n 6 marine and protected shipwreck sites.\\nSetting\\n9.21 Setting33 is defined as the surroundings in \\nwhich a heritage asset is experienced as it evolves \\nover time. The historic town core is surrounded by the Harbour and the regeneration areas. Both sides of the Back Water Channel are within the setting of the Town Centre Heritage Conservation Area. The ancient Canford Manor, with adjacent hamlets at Ashington, Oakley and Knighton are set within the Green Belt and Stour river valley to the north. Areas to the north of the borough have special historic character that enhances the conservation areas and hamlets that have evolved within them. \\n9.22 The listed and locally listed buildings and the \\narchaeological sites also have their own individual settings. The setting of listed buildings is given special consideration in legislation. Preservation of the setting of historic towns is recognised as one of the functions of the Green Belt. Change within the settings of these heritage assets can be beneficial, provided impacts are carefully considered within the decision making process of planning. \\nDevelopment management\\n9.23 There are pressures to modernise or \\ndemolish historic buildings, change their uses, develop within conservation areas and remove landscaping to the detriment of their character and integrity. A lack of consistent signage, regular building maintenance and inappropriate infill from the post war period has resulted in an eroded and poorly coordinated public realm in the town centre.\\n9.24 Given the irreplaceable contribution heritage \\nassets make to the cultural, social and economic fabric of the town, it is important that the Borough’s assets and their settings are safeguarded as a reminder of the history and evolution of Poole through sensitive enhancement and high quality design. \\n9.25 Management of development within \\nconservation areas will need to preserve or enhance by better revealing the character or appearance and setting of the area. Proposals for development will need to consider the local distinctiveness of the area, including the bulk, scale, height, mass, roof forms, materials, use(s) appropriate to the site and surrounding buildings, road and street patterns and views. Some of Poole’s conservation areas have a cohesiveness that would be enhanced through carefully designed infill buildings that reflect historic precedents, for example in Poole town centre. Other areas such as Branksome Park are more diverse in appearance and can accommodate innovative contemporary designs as long as the existing building has no historic merit and the landscaping, rhythm, massing and proportion of \\n32Planning (Listed Buildings and Cons ervation Areas) Act 1990 and the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act (1979)\\n33Historic England, The Setting of Heritage Assets, HE Good Practice Advice in Planning Note 3 (second edition) (2017)Merley House Grade I Listed\\n', doc_id='cf725aa3-459b-4d8a-a653-5597aa0f59a3', embedding=None, doc_hash='e75a8b495a99cd3015eaa4a4c49a5e2e70243b038032caf3389ed8f408d74af2', extra_info={'page_label': 'b97', 'file_name': 'poole_local_plan.pdf'}), Document(text='Poole Local Plan98proposed development respects the prevailing \\nstreet scene. Developments will be encouraged that use creative solutions to utilize gap sites, vacant historic buildings including those that are locally listed, or floors within them and small sites. \\n9.26 It is important that heritage assets are \\nretained in a viable use which is consistent with their conservation and often a commercial use is appropriate. Whilst this will be supported, associated proposals should be sensitively designed to reflect/respond to the affected heritage asset, and should result in the heritage asset and its setting being either preserved or enhanced. Typically signs and advertisements within conservation areas or on listed and locally listed buildings are not internally illuminated and internally illuminated boxing should be avoided wherever possible. Other developments associated to commercial use (such as air conditioning units, CCTV, security alarms, decking, renewables etc.) may not be appropriate for heritage assets. Heritage Strategy\\n9.27 A key Council initiative will be to pursue \\nfunding opportunities and to work with land owners in order to secure improvements that enable the Town Centre Heritage Conservation Area to be removed from the ‘Heritage at Risk’ Register and to enhance other conservation areas wherever feasible. \\n9.28 This heritage strategy will be supported \\nthrough the publication and implementation of conservation area appraisals, the use of Article 4 Directions with the support of the public and private sector, where necessary. 9.29 The Council continues to prepare and/or review conservation area appraisals and management plans. Over half of the conservation areas now have adopted appraisals which provide a detailed assessment of the significance of each area and help to guide development within historic areas. Some appraisals also have management plans with suggestions on ways of improving the environment. \\n9.30 The Council will review the heritage assets \\nSPD to ensure it is kept up to date, with particular regard to the non-designated, locally listed heritage assets.\\nArchaeological sites\\n9.31 Poole has some significant land based \\narchaeological sites and marine sites, including shipwrecks. Areas of key archaeological interest, include the town centre (south of the railway line), a Roman Fort at Ashington, and a Roman Road that forms part of the western boundary between Poole, Purbeck and East Dorset linked to a Roman Port at Lower Hamworthy. 9.32 Given the archaeological potential of the Town Centre Heritage Conservation Area, any development within it that involves excavation will require a written scheme of archaeological investigation. These reports need to be prepared at an early stage in the assessment of the development potential of the site and submitted with the planning application. The findings of the report will identify the potential for finds within the site. In some cases, field evaluations may be considered necessary before development commences. Where remains are discovered, they will normally be recorded and preserved in situ or, if excavated, be acquired by Poole Museum or the relevant repository. In the town centre, some lamp posts are listed and alongside drain covers and channels, were locally made in Poole’s foundries. These street furnishings and ironworks should be repaired and safeguarded for future use as artefacts of Poole’s industrial heritage.  Renewable energy and traditional buildings\\n \\n9.33 Adapting traditional buildings (normally built before 1919 in solid wall construction) by draught-proofing, insulating lofts and using other measures is the most effective way to increase energy efficiency. Solid wall insulation will only be permitted where risks can be avoided, such as moisture build-up and excessive condensation.

The Council will use the assessment of significance to determine the level of impact a development may have and, subsequently, the need to minimise, mitigate or do nothing depending on the nature of the impact. The Council will provide guidance on what applicants need to consider when preparing heritage assessments. 9.35 The assessment should include: (i) a description of the heritage asset in sufficient detail to determine its historic, architectural, artistic and/or archaeological interest to a level proportionate with its status; (ii) set out an understanding of the significance, context and/or setting of the asset; and (iii) assess the impact of the proposal on the asset and its setting.  \\nPolicy PP30\\nHeritage assets\\n(1) New development\\nThe Council will expect development to preserve or enhance Poole’s heritage assets.

As well as providing a significant scenic feature, the coast is a particularly important tourism and employment asset, an invaluable recreational resource and a protected wildlife habitat. To the north the open heathland, farmland and Stour Valley provide a valued landscaped setting for the town. \\nThe coast\\n \\n9.38 The features that contribute to the character and appearance of the shoreline and the coastal hinterland vary along its length. The cliffs and chines fronting Poole Bay have a largely natural appearance in some areas, exposing geological layering, with sandy beaches backed by relatively steep cliffs. The sheltered shallow waters of Poole Harbour and its islands comprise a mosaic of mudflats, sandflats, saltmarshes and reed beds. The western edge of Poole Harbour falls within the Dorset Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) where protection is extended to include the need to ensure quiet enjoyment of the area and the conservation and enhancement of the natural beauty of the landscape. The interface of the built up area with the coast contains a mixture of open space, commercial, residential and marine activities, the character of which varies in different parts of the Harbour. Policy PP31: Poole’s coast and countryside aims to ensure that within the Coastal Zone identified on the Policies Map the features that contribute to the distinctive shoreline character of Poole are preserved and enhanced. The Shoreline Character Areas Supplementary Planning Guidance defines the shoreline character along the coast.\\n9.39 Sandbanks has an iconic beachline which is \\nan important recreational amenity and a popular tourist destination. However, due to the economic land value, opportunities for re-development within Sandbanks are also highly sought after. Therefore, the policy seeks to protect the beach itself from over-development by only permitting minor ancillary structures such as single storey boathouses, shelters, slipways, groins and beach nourishment works, within 25m of the landward edge of the beach.\\n Poole’s beaches \\n9.40 The Sustaining Poole’s Seafront SPD \\nprovides a flexible framework and overall structure for understanding and developing the seafront area within Sandbanks and along the beaches fronting Poole Bay. It includes a range of implementable projects which are aimed at conserving the beautiful natural environment; improving the range of facilities to encourage visitors all year round; and investing in ageing infrastructure to preserve core services. Possible facilities range from cafés to sporting facilities and kiosks. There are also opportunities to provide additional beach huts, which are highly valued by visitors and local residents.\\nBoating, mooring and jetties\\n \\n9.41 A range of boating activities take place within the coastal area both for recreation and commercial purposes.

To comply with law, the Council has to ensure that new development does not have an adverse effect on important areas of nature conservation. If adverse impacts are unavoidable then mitigation should be put in place to negate the harm caused. \\nDorset Heathlands\\n \\n9.47 Evidence shows that the Dorset Heaths are under significant pressure from urban development. The Council as decision maker is the competent authority under the Habitats Regulations and is advised by Natural England in how to fulfil these duties. Natural England advise that due to the potential adverse impact on heathland principally arising from human pressures and damage caused by domestic pets, further residential development should not be permitted within 400 metres of a designated heathland. As the majority of visitors to the heathland live within 5km of the site Natural England advise that between 400 metres and 5km residential development would have such a significant effect that mitigation is required. \\n9.48 Natural England advise that residential \\ndevelopment should not be permitted within 400 metres of a designated heathland. However, there can be exceptions to this for certain types of care homes (restricted to full nursing home provision, providing necessary nursing care, such as for advanced dementia or physical nursing needs), where residents are unable to freely leave to walk on the heath or keep pets. All new residential development and tourist accommodation between 400 metres and 5km of a designated heathland, which includes all of Poole, has to provide mitigation measures. There may be other land uses, which if in close proximity to the protected heathlands, can lead to increased recreational or access related disturbance. These will be considered on a case by case basis.\\n9.49 An important aspect of mitigation is the \\nprovision of SANGs, which works in conjunction with additional access management measures on the European and internationally important sites. \\n35Poole Landscape Character Area Assessment (2007)\\n36Dorset Heathlands Special Protection Area (SPA), Dorset Heaths Special Area of Conservation (SAC), Dorset Heathlands Ramsar site, Poole Harbour Ramsar site, & Poole \\nHarbour (SPA)Heathland in Poole\\n', doc_id='53857a4f-bacf-41cf-8b91-af7fafbc58ed', embedding=None, doc_hash='73743292af97aed99633a87dcae7d6c20443121ddda2e4b55f82079e04f75990', extra_info={'page_label': 'b102', 'file_name': 'poole_local_plan.pdf'}), Document(text='Poole Local Plan103SANGs provide new areas of public open space \\nthat are convenient and dog friendly, providing an alternative to heathland. The overarching aim of the provision of SANGs is to divert visitor pressure to ensure that there is no net increase in recreation pressure on protected heathland.\\n9.50 The principle of the heathland buffer areas \\nand a detailed strategy for mitigation are set out more fully within the Dorset Heathlands Planning Framework SPD.\\n \\nPoole Harbour \\n9.51 Evidence demonstrates that there are two \\nparticular pressures on the Harbour; (i) nitrate pollution and (ii) recreational issues.  9.52 Nitrogen causes the growth of algal mats that restrict the food (invertebrates) available for protected birds and the Poole Harbour Nutrient Management Plan\\n37, identifies a need to reduce \\nnitrogen in the Harbour. The majority of nitrogen is generated by agriculture, but a proportion is generated from human sewage. The Council in planning for population growth has to ensure that additional nitrogen generated through sewage from new housing development in the catchment of Poole Harbour is mitigated. Mitigation can be ‘direct’ through upgrading sewage treatment works or ‘indirect’ by offsetting the nitrogen generated from new development by taking land out of a nitrogen intensive use, e.g. fields where nitrogen fertiliser is applied. Tourism accommodation such as hotels, restaurants and caravans can also generate a net increase of nitrogen in the catchment and must therefore provide mitigation. If new tourism accommodation does not pay CIL, schemes will need to provide bespoke mitigation measures, secured through a S106 agreement. Nitrogen mitigation is not necessary for employment, commercial or retail uses. More detail about this issue including which uses should provide mitigation is set out in the Nitrogen Reduction in Poole Harbour SPD.\\n9.53 Recreational pressures can also have a \\nharmful effect on the Harbour. More activity within the Harbour (e.g. boats) and on the shoreline (e.g. dog walkers, bait digging) can frighten off protected birds. Visitor surveys indicate that people from across Poole visit the Harbour. Therefore all new residential and tourism development in Poole has to provide mitigation to ensure the impact of additional visitors to Poole Harbour can be managed without causing harm to protected wildlife. The Council has implemented some measures to mitigate recent development in Poole town centre, in particular wardening around the Harbour’s edge. The Council plans to formalise the mitigation by producing a Recreation in Poole Harbour SPD. The SPD will be progressed alongside the Poole Local Plan with the aim of implementation commencing in 2019. The SPD will determine the level of contribution that development will have to provide and the projects necessary to mitigate potential harm to the Harbour.\\n9.54 In 2017 the Poole Harbour SPA was \\nextended to incorporate the sub-tidal areas of the Harbour and also low lying areas of Lytchett Bay. Furthermore Natural England is also proposing to designate a new Solent and Dorset Coast SPA to protect the habitats of sea birds that plunge dive for food.\\n9.55 The Council is a member of the Poole \\nHarbour Steering Group. This group is a voluntary partnership providing a framework for coordination between statutory bodies to review, prepare and implement common plans and policies, with a view to promoting the sustainable use of Poole Harbour, whilst securing the long-term conservation of its European and internationally important sites.

Some developments will also be required to implement other mitigation measures, determined on a case by case basis.  The Council will work with neighbouring Councils, statutory bodies and landowners to implement the mitigation measures and secure them in perpetuity. The mitigation strategy includes the provision of:\\n(a) Upton Country Park SANGs; \\n(b) SANGs within the concept of the Stour Valley Park, linked to housing \\nsites UE1 North of Merley, UE2 North of Bearwood and U2 West of Bearwood; and \\n(c) other SANGs and Heathland Infrastructure Projects (HIPs) identified \\nthrough updates of the Heathlands Planning Framework SPD.\\nThe Council will review the Poole Local Plan by 2023.

A study into the success of mitigation measures since 2007 will be a fundamental part of the evidence base. If there is no certainty that development will not have an adverse impact upon protected wildlife, the Council may not be able to grant planning permission for certain types of harmful development, such as housing.\\n  \\n(b) Recreational effectsDevelopment proposals for any net increase in homes or tourist accommodation will provide a SAMM contribution for wardening, education and monitoring, to mitigate the adverse effects of recreation related pressures within Poole Harbour in accordance with the adopted SPD. \\nDevelopment proposals may be required to contribute to the \\nimplementation of the Poole Harbour SPA European Marine Site Management Scheme where the identified effects can be best addressed.', doc_id='97f9b122-3071-4838-b0dc-4d8ae2b29d9c', embedding=None, doc_hash='aabacf4d78b8a91378ffbcc57fd41ea1ca5ab4ec6dd4beaab4b331f59f7722df', extra_info={'page_label': 'b104', 'file_name': 'poole_local_plan.pdf'}), Document(text='Poole Local Plan1059.56 The mitigation strategies are set out in the \\nthree SPD’s previously referred to and the specific projects are listed within the Poole Infrastructure Plan. The Council will secure mitigation for development through upfront contributions in the form of CIL and S106 Agreements for infrastructure projects such as SANGs, and through S111 or S106 Agreements for Strategic Access, Management and Monitoring (SAMMs), which provides wardening of protected sites, education and monitoring. All residential types that result in a net increase in dwellings will need to be accounted for through Council monitoring to secure the appropriate amount of mitigation. \\nMonitoring the success of mitigation measures9.57 The Council with its partners commenced \\nimplementing heathland mitigation in 2007. It was recognised at the time that it would take at least 10 years of monitoring to inform a meaningful review of the effectiveness of mitigation measures. This would enable time for SANGs to be delivered and established and to account for fluctuations in species populations, for example, caused by particularly cold winters. \\n9.58 The Habitats Regulations Assessment (HRA) \\nof the Poole Local Plan recommends that an extensive study is undertaken across South East Dorset to assess whether the suite of different mitigation projects have ensured that there has been no adverse effect to protected wildlife from new development. There is currently capacity in deliverable SANGs to mitigate growth to 2023, when the Poole Plan is due for review. This review will need to incorporate the findings of any such future study and reassess strategic growth beyond 2023. \\n9.59 In the meantime the Council will continue to \\nidentify potential SANGs and bring them forward to mitigate growth beyond 2023, in preparation for future reviews of the Poole Local Plan. The Dorset Heathlands Planning Framework SPD will be updated by 2020 and can incorporate these new projects. The two strategic urban extensions at Merley and at Bearwood can bring forward SANGs to mitigate harm from those particular developments. The Council will work with landowners to identify opportunities to link those SANGs with other SANGs in the vicinity to create the Stour Valley Park. This project is developing with the support of Natural England, and has the potential to create a major draw for residents across Poole and could provide a longer term answer to heathland mitigation in South East Dorset. \\n9.60 To provide the certainty required to comply \\nwith the requirements of the Habitats Regulations, the Council is therefore including key target dates to ensure that successful mitigation can be provided ahead of development. The Local Plan review in 2023, in particular, will be a key milestone. \\nLocal biodiversity\\n9.61 The Council has a specific duty set out in the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006 to conserve biodiversity.  Species of national importance are set out on the Section 41 List of Species of Principal Importance. Species and habitats of local importance are identified within the Dorset Biodiversity Strategy\\n39 and are \\nalso recognised with designated Sites of Nature Conservation Interest (SNCI), Local Nature Reserves (LNRs) and habitats and species of principal importance to biodiversity, including ancient woodland, veteran trees, watercourses and wetlands. \\n9.62 Biodiversity assets, including those protected \\nby international designations down to species and habitats of local importance, function together in a coherent way, to enable wildlife to thrive. Maintaining and enhancing a well-connected and healthy network of biodiversity assets is an integral part of sustainable development. The Dorset Local Nature Partnership has published maps showing existing and potential ecological networks which \\n39Dorset Biodiversity Strategy www.dorsetwildlifetrust.org.uk/the_dorset_biodiversity_strategy.htmlUpton Country Park SANG\\n', doc_id='14457ca3-fbbc-471c-b5dc-99657fe4fffb', embedding=None, doc_hash='961036d6711c53b80d409ffc446ce50df78964f7a6de6952429a681d2eaa895b', extra_info={'page_label': 'b105', 'file_name': 'poole_local_plan.pdf'}), Document(text='Poole Local Plan106are publicly available on Dorset Explorer40 and \\nwhich should form the basis for consideration in \\nany proposal. \\n9.63 New development has an important role \\nto play in reversing biodiversity declines, and should seek to demonstrate how the development will result in a ‘Net Gain’ for biodiversity. All development provides opportunities to enhance the natural environment for wildlife. New development is therefore expected to demonstrate, particularly through habitat creation or restoration, landscaping, public open space and SuDS, how the development will create better opportunities for wildlife than before. 9.64 Development which has the potential to impact upon protected sites, habitats and species, or any sites over 0.1 hectares, should undertake a biodiversity appraisal to document the likely impacts and mitigation. The appraisal should be similar to that advocated by the Biodiversity Appraisal Protocol in Dorset. All effects should be considered, including positive and negative, direct and indirect, cumulative, and on and off-site impacts over the lifetime of the development (including construction), giving consideration to disturbance effects such as noise, lighting, recreational pressures, trampling, traffic, domestic pets, vandalism etc. The appraisal will typically require site surveys, the method of surveys and level of detail will vary according to the size and type of development and whether any priority species and habitats exist on site. To secure a net gain for biodiversity new development should incorporate ecologically sensitive design features for biodiversity, demonstrated through the biodiversity appraisal process. Where necessary the appraisal process should involve consultation and advice from the Council, the Dorset Wildlife Trust, Dorset County Council and Natural England. 9.65 Any adverse effects identified should ideally be avoided for example through considering the location of development on the site, the use of buffer areas or biodiversity corridors. If it is not possible to avoid the impacts, measures should be taken to reduce the impact as far as possible.  This may involve modifying the development, reinstating lost habitat or the relocation of species/habitat. As a last resort compensation may be needed where the other approaches are not possible and unavoidable losses are outweighed by other considerations. Compensation measures should be delivered within the development site where possible; however, where this is not feasible, it may be more appropriate to deliver off-site measures secured through legal agreements. 9.66 The Council will ensure that there is adequate implementation of biodiversity mitigation and monitoring of ‘net gains’ secured through the planning system. The records of habitats and species held by the Dorset Environmental Records Centre (DERC) serve to provide a useful desktop guide for developers to understand the known protected species present, but may need to be supplemented by further surveys and baseline species studies undertaken by the developer. The Council will also pro-actively encourage developers to submit their species recordings to DERC.\\nGeodiversity\\n9.67 The Dorset Local Geodiversity Action \\nPlan aims to promote the conservation and enhancement of geology, provide guidance and increase the appreciation and understanding of the geological heritage of the area.

The Council’s strategic approach is to address traffic congestion by facilitating and promoting sustainable modes of transport, reducing the need to travel and reliance on the private car. Not only is this the most sustainable approach and consistent  with government policy, the constrained nature of the transport network and available funding dictates that there is limited scope for significantly increasing road capacity. In order to accommodate the planned growth the Council will therefore focus on enabling sustainable travel as well as making better use of existing transport infrastructure.\\n10.2 The Council will continue its work to explore \\nhow innovative technologies, smart data and better connectivity can help to transform the transport network, make sustainable transport easier and more attractive, reduce traffic congestion, reduce \\n10.

Through partnership working, Bournemouth, Poole and Dorset have jointly adopted LTP3 (2011-2026). The South East Dorset Multi Modal Transport Study (SEDMMTS) was jointly produced in 2012, which is used to identify the transport needs for the South East Dorset conurbation, based on forecast levels of future growth. The SEDMMTS identified schemes across the wider conurbation which would contribute to delivery of an integrated transport system to meet future needs.  \\n10.4 LTP3 has established a range of interventions \\nwhich together aim to contribute to the following five strategic goals:  \\n(i) support the economy; \\n(ii) reduce carbon emissions; (iii) improve safety, security and health; \\n(iv) promote equal opportunity; and (v) improve quality of life.\\nThese goals will help to deliver the vision for LTP3 \\nwhich is:\\n “A safe, reliable and accessible low carbon \\ntransport system for Bournemouth, Poole and ', doc_id='055c9b64-ab00-4e18-87a3-caa6456717e5', embedding=None, doc_hash='50db3faee75591a0c2aea8a952b63bfbc59675b872c92861358b206b8ecb15b0', extra_info={'page_label': 'b108', 'file_name': 'poole_local_plan.pdf'}), Document(text='Poole Local Plan109Dorset that assists in the development of a strong \\nlow carbon economy, maximises the opportunities for sustainable transport and respects and protects the area’s unique environmental assets”. \\nDirecting growth to the most accessible \\nlocations \\n10.5 To ensure development takes place in locations \\nwhich will reduce the need to travel and support sustainable modes of transport the Council will direct the majority of growth to the most accessible locations in Poole. As set out in Policy PP2: Amount and broad location of development these are the town centre, district centres, local centres, existing employment areas, and sustainable transport corridors. \\n10.6 A sustainable transport corridor is 400 metres \\neither side of a road capable of extending service provision by the end of the plan period to 4 buses per hour (each way) or within 500 metres radius of a railway station.  Development will need to support the identified sustainable transport corridors (as shown on the Policies Map) by making appropriate contributions to sustainable transport measures, including public transport. For the avoidance of doubt, any curtilage of a property dissected by the corridor as shown on the Policies Map is considered to be within the transport corridor. The principle of high density development (e.g. flats) anywhere within the sustainable transport corridors is accepted, subject to the other policies of the plan (eg. PP27: Design and PP35: A safe, connected and accessible transport network). Any change to the frequency of buses will not be taken into account (i.e. the corridors are set by this Plan and will not be altered until the Local Plan is reviewed).

As Poole is a coastal town, it is also significantly affected by sea level rise and tidal flood risk. Sea levels are forecast to increase by 1.3 metres by 2133, putting approximately 4,000 existing properties at risk of flooding by the end of the plan period compared to approximately 500 properties at risk at the current time\\n44. To meet these challenges effectively and \\naccommodate additional growth, the Poole Local Plan must support the transition to a low carbon future. The two main strands of action are to: \\n(i) reduce carbon dioxide (CO\\n2) emissions to less \\nharmful levels; and(ii) take steps to adapt to, and mitigate for, the \\npotential impact of climate change upon Poole, its residents and the natural environment.\\n11. Protecting Poole from the \\nchallenges of climate change\\nPoole needs to adapt to the effects of climate change and mitigate its impacts to ensure economic, environmental \\nand social well-being is maintained. Projected mean sea level rise makes Poole’s coastal and Harbour areas increasingly vulnerable to the risk of tidal flooding. Securing strategic flood defences, particularly on sites adjacent to Twin Sails Bridge, is critical to ensuring the Old Town is protected from flooding and remains sustainable for future generations. New development must be designed to be resilient to climate change and address its potential to contribute to global warming by reducing greenhouse gas emissions, such as carbon dioxide, produced during construction and occupation and by utilising renewable energy as part of the design.\\n11.2 It is vital therefore that the Council seeks to \\nensure that new development is planned, designed and constructed to respond to anticipated changes in climate, by reducing CO\\n2 emissions where \\npossible and mitigating the impact from flooding and sea level rise. \\n11.3 The Council will expect all development to: \\n(i) ‘be lean’ and designed to reduce overall energy \\nconsumption;  \\n(ii) ‘be clean’ - the building maximises its potential for energy efficiency; and \\n(iii) ‘be green’ to use renewable energy to provide a proportion of its energy needs.\\n11.4 Applicants are encouraged to achieve a good \\nstandard of design and be innovative in meeting the requirements set out in Policy PP37: Building \\n44Poole Flood Risk Management Strategy\\nsustainable homes and businesses.  It is however essential that sustainable design takes account of the policies set out in chapter 9 to ensure that the proposed development contributes to local character, enhances natural features and protects amenity and access.\\nFusion Building Bournemouth University was designed incorporating energy saving technology', doc_id='fecc36f3-3e37-435c-9a12-700670e650b8', embedding=None, doc_hash='05c51315c2fe57fc68fc7a836097a2daf85fb0879d09580d2541eeee6e2a69e1', extra_info={'page_label': 'b113', 'file_name': 'poole_local_plan.pdf'}), Document(text='Poole Local Plan114Renewables and Carbon Reduction\\n11.5 The Council’s Renewable Energy Strategy45  \\nand Sustainable Energy Action Plan46 commit \\nthe Council to reducing Poole’s CO2 emissions, \\nwhich is broadly in line with government targets. \\nThe Council can take a leading role in securing these reductions as future development will be a significant contributor to increased energy demand and increases in CO\\n2 emissions within Poole. It \\nwill also require a move towards more sustainable energy sources.  11.6 It is important to ensure that the approach we take is relevant to Poole’s circumstances so that the policies within the Poole Local Plan are given the chance to contribute in a meaningful way. As one half of all of the country’s CO\\n2 emissions come \\nfrom the energy used in constructing, occupying and heating buildings, building sustainably can make a positive contribution to reducing overall carbon dioxide emissions\\n47.  One of the key areas \\nof action for reducing CO2 emissions in Poole is \\nthrough controlling those emissions in new build developments.  \\n11.7 Building sustainably goes beyond the more \\nobvious energy efficiency measures like better insulation. The use of sustainable construction practices and materials can make a significant difference to reducing CO\\n2 emissions, both by \\nreplacing energy-hungry materials with sustainable ones, and by reducing transportation distances where local sources are found. A high build and design quality increases the life of a dwelling (thereby reducing the need to replace it in the future), lessens its environmental impact during its lifecycle, and can make it more adaptable to changing life circumstances.\\nSustainable homes\\n 11.8 Even for individual dwellings, it would be feasible to generate up to 17.5% of energy from renewable sources in a relatively straightforward manner. Bearing in mind that modern houses will also be built to higher energy efficiency levels which will reduce the total energy requirement, it is feasible that an additional 20% could be achieved if solar water is also used to top up space heating (by pre-heating water used in the boiler). Given that new residential development will be required to meet a variety of community infrastructure needs, it would be reasonable to require a minimum target of renewable energy production to be met, proportionate to the scale of development\\n48.\\nCommercial buildings\\n11.9 The Building Research Establishment has \\ndeveloped an assessment method and rating system (BREEAM) for commercial buildings which considers a wide range of sustainability considerations. BREEAM as a tool determines the performance of new buildings against a list of categories. Credits can be achieved in each BREEAM assessment category which are added together then percentage weighting applied to produce a final score and rating percentage. The targets are Pass (30%), Good (45%), Very Good (55%) Excellent (70%) Outstanding (85%). \\n11.10 In considering planning applications for \\ncommercial schemes, the Council will expect non-residential developments up to 1,000 sq. m to achieve at least a BREEAM ‘very good’ rating. For larger schemes (over 1,000 sq. m net floor space), there is potential to achieve the higher BREEAM ‘excellent’ rating. As with residential development, some sites may also have potential to secure a greater supply of energy from on-site renewable sources. This would allow for a much better reduction in CO\\n2 emissions. In such cases, \\nachieving a BREEAM ‘excellent’ rating would also be made easier as this would contribute to overall CO\\n2 reductions. \\n45Bournemouth, Dorset & Poole Renewable Energy Strategy (2013)\\n46Poole Sustainable Energy Action Plan (2013)\\n47UK Green Building Council\\n48Poole Viability Study (2017)\\nSolar panels', doc_id='2c9d3180-2e77-4943-af0f-34a857431f71', embedding=None, doc_hash='98576281a9c1415cac62552c8ee675d4938ef44498d7f08f914e4217804e1893', extra_info={'page_label': 'b114', 'file_name': 'poole_local_plan.pdf'}), Document(text='Poole Local Plan11511.11 Applications for commercial development \\nshould include a BREEAM pre-assessment, undertaken by a licensed BREEAM assessor or a BREEAM accredited professional to demonstrate how the target rating will be met.\\n11.12 Commercial development includes (but is \\nnot limited to) uses for retail, office, industrial, healthcare and education.

Parts of the urban area are also at risk from ground and surface water flooding as a consequence of extreme rainfall events. The Council is developing flood risk modelling that will be used to predict the extent of future flooding events from tidal, river and ground and surface water sources, or a combination of these. The future tidal flood risk areas and fluvial Flood Zone 3 are shown in Figure 41, is based on outputs of the 2017 SFRA. 11.17 The NPPF states that future development must have regard to flood risk. This is achieved  through the application of the sequential test, which seeks to direct development to areas of  lower risk of flooding. If the development can pass this test then an exception test and site specific flood risk assessment will be required to understand and minimise the risks to ensure a safe development.  \\n11.18 The Local Plan expects a significant amount of Poole’s \\nfuture development needs, particularly housing, will be delivered in and around the town centre and Twin Sails regeneration area.

In an urban area like Poole the majority of SuDS, particularly on smaller developments, will take the form of soakaways or permeable paving. On larger developments they may be incorporated into development as reed beds, swales, filter strips and ponds.  \\n11.23 The Council is producing a series of Surface Water Management Plans (SWMPs) to address flooding from all sources and provide additional detail to the Environment Agency’s surface water mapping. Flood Risk Assessment’s will need to reference the appropriate SWMP and identify adaptation and mitigation measures, including SuDS, to ensure that flood risk is not increased elsewhere and, where achievable, will reduce flood risk overall.adjustments made to rationalise the boundary and the evidence relating to the sequential/exception test for the area has also been updated. \\n11.19 To date, the Council’s strategy for the protection of the Old Town area \\nof Poole from the risk of tidal flooding, has relied on the delivery of strategic flood defences as integral components of developments on regeneration sites on West Quay Road and fronting the Back Water Channel. These long-standing allocated sites represent a ‘gap’ in central Poole’s flood defences which leaves the Old Town of Poole vulnerable to tidal flooding. Should these sites remain undeveloped, it would be prudent for the Council, in conjunction with the Environment Agency and other relevant bodies, to consider how this situation can be remedied through the exploration of alternative options to the delivery of strategic flood defences.\\n11.20 The Council will continue to explore an ‘adaptive management’ \\napproach, similar to that used for publicly funded flood defence schemes, ', doc_id='c80065df-582a-46ea-9a4c-739512045181', embedding=None, doc_hash='a8d8200d15d904b5de886c409621b085757d0d9201c1f9609698fed28b211a39', extra_info={'page_label': 'b118', 'file_name': 'poole_local_plan.pdf'}), Document(text='Poole Local Plan119\\n© Crown Copyright and database right 2018.\\nOrdnance Survey 1000124248.SuDS potentially viableSuDS viable\\nKEY\\nSuDS impractical\\nFigure 43: Suitability of areas in Poole for the provision of SuDs50Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA): \\nNon-statutory technical standards for sustainable drainage systems \\n(2015).11.24 Proposals for SuDS should be appropriate to the location \\nand designed to manage surface water run-off in accordance with the appropriate technical standards\\n50.

A key challenge for the Council is to ensure the delivery of strategic infrastructure in a timely manner to support growth as it comes forward over the plan period and beyond. The Infrastructure Plan is therefore a ‘live’ document that will be updated on an annual basis to ensure that development can contribute to identified infrastructure needs required to support growth throughout the plan period.

The Council will ensure the Infrastructure Plan us updated to maintain a rolling five-year list of infrastructure requirements.\\n12.6 In a climate of constrained capital and public \\nfunding, the ability of the council to deliver strategic infrastructure will remain a challenge. Therefore, the council will need to ensure that available funding opportunities are secured. Due to the constrained nature of public funding, development will be expected to make a reasonable and proportional contribution towards meeting infrastructure needs, which will be secured through a range of measures including CIL (or any successor regime), S106, S111 and S278 Agreements.\\nCommunity Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and use \\nof Section 106/278 agreements\\n12.7 The CIL charge is levied on new development \\non a ‘£ per sq. m’ basis in accordance with prescribed regulations.

Once a project is identified on the Regulation 123 list the Council cannot use any Section 106 or Section 278 to secure contributions and/or delivery of the project to provide a transparent system where developers can be confident that they have not paid twice for infrastructure. Finance raised through CIL is only to be used on infrastructure required to support the development of the area, not to remedy pre-existing deficiencies. CIL can therefore be used for new infrastructure, or to increase the capacity of existing infrastructure to support growth. Although CIL will make a significant contribution towards funding strategic infrastructure, public funding will continue to bear the main burden. CIL is intended to fill the funding gaps that remain once existing sources of funding have been taken into account. \\n12.9 The Council will maintain an up to date \\nCIL Charging Schedule and Regulation 123 List alongside the Local Plan.

For a scheme to be considered deliverable, it should be able to come forward within five years or until a planning permission expires.\\n12.12 Of importance, only schemes that are \\ndeliverable can be included in the Council’s five year rolling supply of sites in the SHLAA. \\n12.13 It remains a challenge for the Council to \\nensure that planning permissions are deliverable to ensure development needs are met as expected over the plan period. It is also important to ensure that delivery of strategic objectives such as providing affordable housing are not compromised by multiple schemes approved on the same sites that can inadvertently artificially affect land values and consequently scheme viability. \\n12.14 To assist the Council in determining whether \\na scheme is deliverable and can deliver the expected policy requirements set out in this Plan, the Council will require the ‘benchmark land value’ used for viability appraisals to be based on the ‘existing use value plus’ approach. The ‘alternative use value’ approach will only be accepted where there is valid consent for the alternative use, it is proven to be deliverable and it fully complies with the development plan. These terms are defined in the glossary. The Council will also set out in future guidance its approach to Vacant Building Credit.\\n12.15 Furthermore, the design of schemes should \\nnot be at the expense to the provision of affordable housing and other planning obligations required to make a proposal acceptable in planning terms. Some parts of Poole are particularly attractive to the development of more luxurious residential units, but the size of the unit, communal floor space, car parking and landscaping proposed should not be at the expense of providing affordable housing. \\n12.16 For these reasons, all proposed schemes \\nsubmitted to the Council as planning applications should be (i) deliverable; and (ii) should show that applicants have maximised opportunities to provide affordable housing through the design of the scheme. The Council will require a ‘declaration of deliverability’ on the validation checklist for all major planning applications.\\n12.17 If an applicant submits a policy compliant \\nproposal, a residual land value assessment will not be required.\\nProposals for change of use12.18 There is often pressure on lower value uses \\n(community uses, hotels and employment land) to be redeveloped for uses that will bring high value to the developer, especially housing.

In accordance with national policy, affordable housing includes social rented, affordable rented and intermediate housing, provided to eligible households whose needs are not met by the market. For Poole, the Council uses the discount rate formula (as set out in the Affordable Housing SPD) on individual applications to inform the type of affordable housing that needs to be provided on site to ensure that it is provided to households whose needs are not met by the market. This discounted rate formula is based on the current average (median) annual gross full time income in Poole is approx. £26k per annum. \\nAlternative Use Value (AUV) Developments may often have previous planning approvals for the site, which could be used to calculate an AUV for the \\nsite.
