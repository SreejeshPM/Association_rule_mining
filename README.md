# Association_rule_mining
A repo containing my association rule mining projects and results.

Association rule mining is the data mining process of finding the rules that may govern associations
between sets of items. The term market basket analysis refers to a specific implementation of
association rules mining that many companies use for a variety of purposes, so in a given
transaction with multiple items, it tries to find the rules that govern how or why such items are often
bought together. Association rules are rules which surpass a user-specified minimum support and
minimum Confidence threshold.
