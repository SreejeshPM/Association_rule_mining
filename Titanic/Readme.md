The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg,
killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.

One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck
involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than
others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.

The titanic dataset contains the passenger details of the RMS titanic. These are Class, Age, Sex, and Survived. My goal was to identify the passengers who had high favorability of survival and people has the lowest favorability of surviving the titanic crash. With SAS enterprise miner I have tried the testing and the results are shown above.
