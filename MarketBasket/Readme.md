Association rule mining
=======================
Association rule mining is the data mining process of finding the rules that may govern associations
between sets of items. The term market basket analysis refers to a specific implementation of
association rules mining that many companies use for a variety of purposes, so in a given
transaction with multiple items, it tries to find the rules that govern how or why such items are often
bought together. Association rules are rules which surpass a user-specified minimum support and
minimum Confidence threshold. For example, peanut butter and jelly are often bought together
because a lot of people like to make sandwiches using these two items. Also, surprisingly, diapers
and beer are bought together because, as it turns out, that dads are often tasked to do the
shopping while the moms are left with the baby. 

The main applications of association rule mining:
      • Basket data analysis - is to analyse the association of purchased items in a single basket or single purchase.
      • Cross marketing - is to work with other businesses that complement your own, not competitors.
      • Catalogue design - the selection of items in a business’ catalogue are often designed to complement each other so that buying one item will 
      lead to buying of another. So these items are often complements or very related.

In this analysis, we try to figure out most associated items that drive the sale of Heineken.
